	abstract = {PURPOSE: MET alterations including amplifications and nucleotide variations have  been associated with resistance to therapy and aggressive clinical behavior. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The medical records of patients presenting to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Phase I Clinic with relapsed or metastatic ovarian cancers and known MET nucleotide variation or amplification status were reviewed retrospectively (n=178). Categorical and continuous clinical and molecular characteristics were compared using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, respectively. Univariate and multivariate survival were assessed  via Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis, respectively. RESULTS: MET amplification occurred in 4 (3.5\%) of 113 patients, whereas nonsynonomous nucleotide variations were present in 9 (7.4\%) of 122 patients. No patients exhibited concomitant amplification and variation. MET variations were observed only in white women with high-grade ovarian tumors, whereas amplifications were observed in both black and white women with high-grade serous ovarian primary tumors. No patients (n=4) exhibiting a MET alteration achieved an objective response when treated on a c-Met inhibitor phase I trial. In addition, ovarian cancer patients treated with a c-Met inhibitor with multikinase activity trended  towards a longer time-to-failure compared with those treated with a c-Met-specific inhibitor (median: 1.5 vs. 4.5 months, p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: MET alterations occur in a minority of patients with ovarian cancer. c-Met inhibitors with multikinase activity may exhibit less activity in ovarian cancer than c-Met  specific drugs. These findings warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {This study was focused on molecular profiling of prostate cancer (PCa) using scant amounts of both frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) PCa tissue specimens. DNA and RNA were extracted and interrogated for: (1) whole-genome gene expression profiling, (2) miRNA expression analysis, (3) SNP analysis, and (4) mutation analysis. Data was statistically analyzed and correlated with clinical and pathologic variables. Expression profiling of 47,224 genes revealed 74 genes that were significant in predicting high tumor grade in PCa (p{\textless}0.0001). These were involved in many cellular processes as analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Using novel high throughput technologies, we identified a specific oncogenomic and miRNA signatures showing loss of miR-34 expression. Interestingly, p53 was at the center hub of the signaling pathways, and the loss of miR-34a expression was consistent with the central role of p53 in PCa. Analysis of 731,442 SNP's, revealed 638 SNP's that were significant in predicting high tumor grade (p{\textless}0.0001; logistic regression analysis). We also found, for the first time, a novel hot spot mutation in MET oncogene, variant T992I, suggesting that our findings would be useful in further defining the role  of specific regulatory genes and miRNAs in the pathological evolution of PCa, and could also have potential clinical utility in improving diagnostic accuracy, refining prognostic and predictive capabilities and may serve as therapeutic targets.},

From the array  data, calls could be made for approximately 97.5\% of the bases, and false positive rates were very low with only a single mutation reported from the array  dataset for which the corresponding dideoxy trace had a clean wildtype sequence.  For the nucleotide positions where array calls were made, false negative rates were 1.41\% for heterozygous mutations. All the homozygous mutations were detected, but 8.11\% were erroneously reported as heterozygous changes from the reference sequence by the array analysis software. In addition, 20 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples were analyzed using the arrays, and both somatic and  germline mutations were found. The most interesting findings were two MET mutations that have recently been implemented in NSCLC. Large scale MALDI-TOF genotyping indicated that one of these mutations (T1010I) might represent a true  cancer-causing genotype, whereas the other (N375S) appears to be a common germline polymorphism.},

	issn = {0147-5185 0147-5185},
	abstract = {Activating mutations affecting the MET receptor tyrosine kinase are present in several types of human cancer, particularly in papillary renal cell carcinoma. Papillary thyroid carcinomas commonly express high levels of MET mRNA and protein, suggesting that increased MET signaling may be of importance in the molecular pathogenesis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate the role  of MET mutations in thyroid carcinoma, we screened MET exons 2 to 21 for mutations in sporadic papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas using denaturing high-performance chromatography. A missense MET sequence alteration T1010I, located in exon 14 encoding for the juxtamembrane domain of MET, was found in 6 (6\%) of the 104 thyroid carcinomas examined, whereas all 92 goiter samples had wild-type exon 14 (P = 0.031). Three (6\%) of the 53 papillary, 2 (10\%) of the 21 follicular, 1 (8\%) of the 13 medullary, and none of the 17 anaplastic carcinomas studied had MET(T1010I). Four of the 6 T1010I sequence alterations were present also in the germline. MET protein expression showed no apparent association with the presence of MET(T1010I), and the clinical features of the patients with cancer with MET(T1010I) were similar to those of patients whose cancer did not harbor MET(T1010I). We conclude that MET(T1010I) sequence alteration is relatively frequent in differentiated thyroid  carcinoma. The clinical and the molecular pathologic significance of this MET sequence alteration is not known.},

	volume = {63},
	issn = {0008-5472 0008-5472},
	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer, and most patients present  with cancer already spread beyond the lung. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-MET has been implicated in various solid tumors, including SCLC, and is involved in mediating tumorigenesis, cell motility, scattering, invasion and metastasis. Mutations of c-Met have been described in renal papillary carcinoma and gastrointestinal cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma. The sequence of  c-MET was examined for possible mutations in the 10 SCLC cell lines and 32 paired-SCLC/normal tissues. Novel c-MET alterations were identified among 3 of 10 separate SCLC cell lines and in 4 of 32 SCLC tumor tissue samples. These include  two different c-MET missense mutations in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain (R988C found in NCI-H69 and H249 cell lines; and T1010I in SCLC tumor sample T31). Also, there are one Sema domain missense mutation (E168D in SCLC tumor sample T5), two-base-pair insertional mutations (IVS13- (52-53)insCT in both SCLC tumor samples T26 and T27) within the pre-JM intron 13, as well as an alternative transcript involving exon 10 (H128 cell line). c-MET receptors are expressed at various levels among the 10 SCLC cell lines studied (high expression: H69, H345,  H510, and H526; medium-expression: H128 and H146; and low/no-expression: H82, H209, H249, and H446). The level of c-MET expression does not have any apparent correlation with presence or absence of mutations of c-MET in the cell lines. We  show that the two identified JM mutations (R988C and T1010I), when introduced into the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent BaF3 cell line, regulated cell proliferation resulting in a small but significant growth factor independence. When introduced into a SCLC cell line (H446, with minimal endogenous wild-type c-MET expression), the JM mutations also regulated cell morphology and adhesion,  as well as causing enhanced tumorigenicity by both increases in focus-formation and soft-agar colony-formation assays. Both of the JM mutations also increased cell motility and migration evident in wound healing assay and time-lapse video-microscopy speed analysis. The JM mutations also altered the c-MET RTK signaling, resulting in preferentially increased constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins, including the key focal adhesion protein paxillin on tyrosine residue Y31 (first CRKL-binding site), correlating with increased motility. These results suggest a novel and unique role of the JM  domain in c-MET signaling in SCLC with significant implications in cytoskeletal functions and metastatic potential. The novel JM gain-of-function somatic mutations described are the first to be reported in SCLC, and may be associated with a more aggressive phenotype. It would now be useful to study the inhibition  of c-MET as a therapeutic target against SCLC.},

	abstract = {Activating mutations in the Met receptor tyrosine kinase, both germline and somatic, have been identified in human papillary renal cancer. Here we report a novel germline missense Met mutation, P1009S, in a patient with primary gastric cancer. The dosage of the mutant Met DNA was elevated in the tumor when compared  to its matched normal DNA. Therefore, as with hereditary renal papillary cancer,  the mutant Met allele may also be selectively duplicated in the tumor. Different  from previously reported Met mutations, which occur in the tyrosine kinase domain, this missense mutation is located at the juxtamembrane domain, and is not constitutively activated. However, following treatment with HGF/SF, the P1009S mutant Met protein, expressed in NIH3T3 cells, displays increased and persistent  tyrosine phosphorylation compared to the wild-type Met. Importantly, these cells  also form colonies in soft agar, and are highly tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. A second nucleotide change in this region of Met, T1010I, was found in a breast cancer biopsy and a large cell lung cancer cell line. Although this previously reported 'polymorphism' did not stimulate NIH3T3 cell growth in soft agar, it was more active than the wild-type Met in the athymic nude mice tumorigenesis assay,  suggesting that it may have effects on tumorigenesis. Met has been shown to be highly expressed in human gastric carcinoma cell lines, and our results raise the possibility that activating missense Met mutations could contribute to tumorigenesis of gastric cancer.},

Previously, we demonstrated missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene in HPRC and a subset of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. In this study, we screened a large panel of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas and various solid tumors for mutations in the MET proto-oncogene. Summarizing these and previous results, mutations of the MET proto-oncogene were detected in 17/129 sporadic papillary renal carcinomas but not in other solid tumors. We detected five novel missense mutations; three of five mutations were located in the ATP-binding region of the  tyrosine kinase domain of MET. One novel mutation in MET, V1110I, was located at  a codon homologous to an activating mutation in the c-erbB proto-oncogene. These  mutations caused constitutive phosphorylation of MET when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Molecular modeling studies suggest that these activating mutations interfere with the intrasteric mechanism of tyrosine kinase autoinhibition and facilitate transition to the active form of the MET kinase. The low frequency of  MET mutations in noninherited papillary renal carcinomas (PRC) suggests that noninherited PRC may develop by a different mechanism than hereditary papillary renal carcinoma.},

Tumor protein p53 is a key tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Paradoxically, some mutant TP53 carriers remain unaffected, while their children  develop cancer within the first few years of life. To address this paradox, response to UV stress was compared in dermal fibroblasts (dFb) from an affected LFS patient vs. their unaffected carrier parent. UV induction of CDKN1A/p21, a regulatory target of p53, in LFS patient dFb was significantly reduced compared to the unaffected parent. UV exposure also induced significantly greater p53[Ser15]-phosphorylation in LFS patient dFb, a reported property of some mutant p53 variants. Taken together, these results suggested that unaffected parental dFb may express an increased proportion of wild-type vs. mutant p53. Indeed, a significantly increased ratio of wild-type to mutant TP53 allele-specific expression in the unaffected parent dFb was confirmed by RT-PCR-RFLP and RNA-seq  analysis. Hence, allele-specific expression of wild-type TP53 may allow an unaffected parent to mount a response to genotoxic stress more characteristic of  homozygous wild-type TP53 individuals than their affected offspring, providing protection from the oncogenesis associated with LFS.},

Clonal bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing showed different methylation levels in different somatic tissues, with the highest level recorded  in rectal mucosa and colon cancer tissue, and the lowest in blood leukocytes.

It is characterized by hundreds of adenomatous colorectal polyps, with an almost inevitable progression to colorectal cancer at  an average age of 35 to 40 yr. Associated features include upper gastrointestinal tract polyps, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, desmoid tumors, and other extracolonic malignancies. Gardner syndrome is more of a historical subdivision of FAP, characterized by osteomas, dental anomalies, epidermal cysts, and soft tissue tumors. Other specified variants include Turcot  syndrome (associated with central nervous system malignancies) and hereditary desmoid disease. Several genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. Attenuated FAP is a phenotypically distinct entity, presenting with fewer than 100 adenomas. Multiple colorectal adenomas can also be caused by mutations in the human MutY homologue (MYH) gene, in an autosomal recessive condition referred to  as MYH associated polyposis (MAP). Endoscopic screening of FAP probands and relatives is advocated as early as the ages of 10-12 yr, with the objective of reducing the occurrence of colorectal cancer. Colectomy remains the optimal prophylactic treatment, while the choice of procedure (subtotal vs proctocolectomy) is still controversial. Along with identifying better chemopreventive agents, optimizing screening of extracolonic cancers and applying new radiological and endoscopic technology to the diagnosis and management of extracolonic features are the major challenges for the future.},

To investigate specificity, a range of cells has been examined for the ability to produce the factor and for sensitivity to its action. Most freshly isolated normal epithelia and epithelia from cell lines of normal tissue, but not epithelia from tumour cell lines or fibroblasts, were sensitive to scatter factor. In contrast, production of the factor, as identified by activity and by chromatography, was restricted to embryonic fibroblasts and certain variants of 3T3 and BHK21 cells and their transformed derivatives. We conclude that the scatter factor is a paracrine effector of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction, which affects the intercellular connections and mobility of normal epithelial cells.

Mutation of the two tyrosines results in loss of biological function, as shown by abrogation of the transforming activity in the oncogenic counterpart of the receptor.

We have previously demonstrated that a single tyrosine residue in the carboxyl terminus, Tyr489, is highly phosphorylated and is essential for efficient transformation of Fr3T3 fibroblasts by Tpr-Met and for the association of Tpr-Met with the Grb2 adaptor protein and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. We show here that Tyr489 is also required for association of Tpr-Met with phospholipase Cgamma and the tyrosine phosphatase, SHPTP2/Syp. To distinguish which of these substrates are required for cell transformation by the Tpr-Met oncoprotein, we generated a novel Tpr-Met mutant that selectively fails to associate with the Grb2 adaptor protein. Utilizing this mutant, together with additional Tpr-Met mutants containing Tyr to Phe substitutions, we have demonstrated that transformation of Fr3T3 fibroblasts by the Tpr-Met oncoprotein is dependent upon pathways downstream of Shc and Grb2 and that pathways downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, phospholipase Cgamma, and SHPTP2/Syp are insufficient for transformation.},

Inappropriate expression of HGF/SF and/or Met has been found in most types of solid tumors and is often associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, constitutional and sporadic activating mutations in Met have been discovered in human papillary renal carcinomas and other cancers, while autocrine and paracrine signaling of this receptor/ligand pair has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Numerous downstream signaling molecules have been implicated in HGF/SF-Met mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis. Stat3 is a downstream signaling molecule activated by HGF/SF-Met signaling, and is reported to contribute to cell transformation induced by a diverse set of oncoproteins. Stat3 is constitutively activated in many primary tumors and tumor cell lines, suggesting that signaling by this molecule may be important for cell transformation. To address whether Stat3 is required for HGF/SF-Met mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis, we introduced a dominant-negative form of Stat3, Stat3beta into the human leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-LMS-1. We found that Stat3beta has no effect on the transformed morphology, proliferation, invasion or branching morphogenesis in vitro. By contrast, expression of Stat3beta affected HGF/SF-Met mediated anchorage-independent colony formation and prevented tumorigenic growth in athymic nu/nu mice. Thus, Met signaling through Stat3 provides an essential function for tumorigenic growth, which is manifested in vitro by loss of anchorage-independent growth.},

	abstract = {Gab1 is a substrate of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met and involved in c-Met-specific branching morphogenesis. It associates directly with c-Met via the c-Met-binding domain, which is not related to known phosphotyrosine-binding domains. In addition, Gab1 is engaged in a constitutive complex with the adaptor protein Grb2. We have now mapped the c-Met and Grb2 interaction sites using reverse yeast two-hybrid technology. The c-Met-binding site is localized to a 13-amino acid region unique to Gab1. Insertion of this site into the Gab1-related protein p97/Gab2 was sufficient to confer c-Met-binding activity. Association with Grb2 was mapped to two sites: a classical SH3-binding site (PXXP) and a novel Grb2 SH3 consensus-binding motif (PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP). To detect phosphorylation-dependent interactions of Gab1 with downstream substrates, we developed a modified yeast two-hybrid assay and identified PI(3)K, Shc, Shp2, and CRKL as interaction partners of Gab1. In a trk-met-Gab1-specific branching morphogenesis assay, association of Gab1 with Shp2, but not PI(3)K, CRKL, or Shc was essential to induce a biological response in MDCK cells. Overexpression of a Gab1 mutant deficient in Shp2 interaction could also block HGF/SF-induced activation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting that Shp2 is critical for c-Met/Gab1-specific signaling.},

Gab1 acts downstream from the Met-hepatocyte growth factor receptor, and Gab1 overexpression promotes Met-dependent morphogenesis of epithelial cells. Recruitment of Gab1 to Met or epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors requires a receptor-binding site for the Grb2 adapter protein and a proline-rich domain in Gab1, defined as the Met-binding domain. To determine the requirement for Grb2 in Gab1 recruitment, we have mapped two Grb2 carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain binding sites conserved in Gab1 and related protein Gab2. One corresponds to a canonical Grb2-binding motif, whereas the second, located within the Gab1 Met-binding domain, requires the proline and arginine residues of an atypical PXXXR motif. The PXXXR motif is required but not sufficient for Grb2 binding, whereas an extended motif, PX3RX2KPX7PLD, conserved in Gab proteins as well as the Grb2/Gads-docking protein, Slp-76, efficiently competes binding of Grb2 or Gads adapter proteins. The association of Gab1 with Grb2 is required for Gab1 recruitment to the EGF receptor but not the Met receptor. Hence different mechanisms of Gab1 recruitment may reflect the distinct biological functions for Gab1 downstream from the EGF and Met receptors.},

Deregulation of this signaling is associated with tumorigenesis and involves, in most cases, overexpression of the receptor. We demonstrate that Met is processed in epithelial cells by presenilin-dependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis (PS-RIP) independently of ligand stimulation. The proteolytic process involves sequential cleavage by metalloproteases and the gamma-secretase complex, leading to generation of labile fragments. In normal epithelial cells, although expression of cleavable Met by PS-RIP is down-regulated, uncleavable Met displayed membrane accumulation and induced ligand-independent motility and morphogenesis. Inversely, in transformed cells, the Met inhibitory antibody DN30 is able to promote Met PS-RIP, resulting in down-regulation of the receptor and inhibition of the Met-dependent invasive growth. This demonstrates the original involvement of a proteolytic process in degradation of the Met receptor implicated in negative regulation of invasive growth.},

	abstract = {Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) modulates cell adhesion, migration, and branching morphogenesis in cultured epithelial cells, events that require regulation of cell-matrix interactions. Using mIMCD-3 epithelial cells, we studied the effect of HGF on the focal adhesion proteins, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin and their association. HGF was found to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and to a lesser degree FAK. In addition, HGF induced association of paxillin and activated ERK, correlating with a gel retardation of paxillin that was prevented with the ERK inhibitor U0126. The ability of activated ERK to phosphorylate and induce gel retardation of paxillin was confirmed in vitro in both full-length and amino-terminal paxillin. Several potential ERK phosphorylation sites in paxillin flank the paxillin-FAK association domains, so the ability of HGF to regulate paxillin-FAK association was examined. HGF induced an increase in paxillin-FAK association that was inhibited by pretreatment with U0126 and reproduced by in vitro phosphorylation of paxillin with ERK. The prevention of the FAK-paxillin association with U0126 correlated with an inhibition of the HGF-mediated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of HGF-dependent cell spreading and adhesion. An examination of cellular localization of FAK and paxillin demonstrated that HGF caused a condensation of focal adhesion complexes at the leading edges of cell processes and FAK-paxillin co-localization in these large complexes. Thus, these data suggest that HGF can induce serine/threonine phosphorylation of paxillin most probably mediated directly by ERK, resulting in the recruitment and activation of FAK and subsequent enhancement of cell spreading and adhesion.},

Upon ligand binding, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (Met) is polyubiquitinated and degraded; however, the mechanisms underlying HGF receptor endocytosis are not yet known. Here we demonstrate that a complex involving endophilins, CIN85 and Cbl controls this process. Endophilins are regulatory components of clathrin-coated vesicle formation. Through their acyl-transferase activity they are thought to modify the membrane phospholipids and induce negative curvature and invagination of the plasma membrane during the early steps of endocytosis. Furthermore, by means of their Src-homology 3 domains, endophilins are able to bind CIN85, a recently identified protein that interacts with the Cbl proto-oncogene. Cbl, in turn, binds and ubiquitinates activated HGF receptor, and by recruiting the endophilin-CIN85 complex, it regulates receptor internalization. Inhibition of complex formation is sufficient to block HGF receptor internalization and to enhance HGF-induced signal transduction and biological responses. These data provide further evidence of a relationship between receptor-mediated signalling and endocytosis, and disclose a novel functional role for Cbl in HGF receptor signalling.},

We demonstrate that although the robust signal to STAT3 elicited from the cytokine oncostatin-M does indeed support this mechanism of STAT3 action, for the weaker STAT3 signal emanating from c-Met, the activated receptor itself needs to be delivered to a perinuclear endosomal compartment to sustain phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus. This is signal specific because c-Met-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase nuclear accumulation does not require receptor trafficking to the perinuclear compartment. This response is triggered from peripheral endosomes. Thus, control of growth factor receptor traffic determines the nature of the signal output, providing novel opportunities for intervention.},

MET is overexpressed in a significant percentage of human cancers and is amplified during the transition between primary tumors and metastasis. To investigate whether this oncogene is directly responsible for the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype, we exploited a single-hit oncogenic version of MET, able to transform and to confer invasive and metastatic properties to nontumorigenic cells, both in vitro and in nude mice. We mutagenized the signal transducer docking site of Met (Y1349VHVX3Y1356VNV), which has the uncommon property of binding and activating multiple src homology region 2 (SH2)-containing intracellular effectors. Notably, a point mutation (H1351 --{\textgreater} N) increased the transforming ability of the oncogene but abolished its metastatic potential. This mutation duplicates the Grb2 binding site, super-activating the Ras pathway and preventing the binding of the other intracellular transducers. Complementation in trans with another nonmetastatic mutant (N1358 --{\textgreater} H), recruiting all the transducers downstream to Met except Grb2, rescued the invasive-metastatic phenotype. It is concluded that the metastatic potential of the MET oncogene relies on the properties of its multifunctional docking site, and that a single point mutation affecting signal transduction can dissociate neoplastic transformation from metastasis.},

Met signaling is mediated by phosphorylation of two carboxy-terminal tyrosines which act as docking sites for a number of SH2-containing molecules.

We previously showed that a Met mutant designed to obtain preferential coupling with Grb2 (Met2xGrb2) is permissive for motility, increases transformation, but - surprisingly - is impaired in causing invasion and metastasis. In this work we used Met mutants optimized for binding either p85 alone (Met2xPI3K) or p85 and Grb2 (MetPI3K/Grb2) to evaluate the relative importance of Ras and PI 3-kinase as downstream effectors of Met. Met2xPI3K was competent in eliciting motility, but not transformation, invasion, or metastasis. Conversely, MetP13K/Grb2 induced motility, transformation, invasion and metastasis as efficiently as wild type Met. Furthermore, the expression of constitutively active PI 3-kinase in cells transformed by the Met2xGrb2 mutant, fully rescued their ability to invade and metastasize. These data point to a central role for PI 3-kinase in Met-mediated invasiveness, and indicate that simultaneous activation of Ras and PI 3-kinase is required to unleash the Met metastatic potential.},

	abstract = {In several types of cells, the activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) requires the coreceptor CD44v6. The CD44 extracellular domain is necessary for c-Met autophosphorylation, whereas the intracellular domain is required for signal transduction. We have already shown that the CD44 cytoplasmic tail recruits ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) proteins to the complex of CD44v6, c-Met, and HGF. We have now defined the function of the ERM proteins and the step they promote in the signaling cascade. The association of ERM proteins to the coreceptor is absolutely required to mediate the HGF-dependent activation of Ras by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos. The ERM proteins need, in addition, to be linked to the actin cytoskeleton to catalyze the activation of Ras. Thus, we describe here a new function of the cytoskeleton. It is part of a "signalosome" complex that organizes the activation of Ras by Sos. So far the cytoskeleton has mainly been identified as a "responder" to signal transduction. Here, we show now that F-actin acts as an "inducer" that actively organizes the signaling cascade.},

Administration of agonistic anti-Fas antibody to mice rapidly led to massive liver apoptosis and fulminant hepatic failure. In contrast, administration of human recombinant hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) abrogated Fas-induced massive liver apoptosis and the lethal hepatic failure. Addition of anti-Fas antibody to hepatocytes in primary culture induced cell death, but Fas-mediated cell death was potently suppressed by HGF. HGF strongly induced Bcl-xL expression and subsequently blocked Fas-mediated signaling pathway upstream of CPP32 in the liver.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) system is an essential inducer of hepatocyte growth and proliferation. Although a fundamental role for the HGF receptor c-Met has been shown in acute liver regeneration, its cell-specific role in hepatocytes during chronic liver injury and fibrosis progression has not been determined.
METHODS: Hepatocyte-specific c-Met knockout mice (c-Met(Delta hepa)) using the Cre-loxP system were studied in a bile duct ligation (BDL) model. Microarray analyses were performed to define HGF/c-Met-dependent gene expression.
RESULTS: Two strategies for c-Met deletion in hepatocytes to generate hepatocyte-specific c-Met knockout mice were tested. Early deletion during embryonic development was lethal, whereas post-natal Cre expression was successful, leading to the generation of viable c-Met(Delta hepa) mice. BDL in these mice resulted in extensive necrosis and lower proliferation rates of hepatocytes. Gene array analysis of c-Met(Delta hepa) mice revealed a significant reduction of anti-apoptotic genes in c-Met-deleted hepatocytes. These findings could be tested functionally because c-Met(Delta hepa) mice showed a stronger apoptotic response after BDL and Jo-2 stimulation. The phenotype was associated with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6) and an enhanced recruitment of neutrophils. Activation of these mechanisms triggered a stronger profibrogenic response as evidenced by increased transforming growth factor-beta(1), alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen-1alpha messenger RNA expression, and enhanced collagen-fiber staining in c-Met(Delta hepa) mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that deletion of c-Met in hepatocytes leads to more liver cell damage and fibrosis in a chronic cholestatic liver injury model because c-Met triggers survival signals important for hepatocyte recovery.},

Aberrations in DNA copy number also were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) using an aliquot of DNA samples. In 5 of 20 HCCs, only 6 oncogenes (CCND1, FGF3/FGF4, SAS/CDK4, TERC, MET, and MYC) were amplified, whereas in the remaining 15 tumors no oncogenes were amplified. A comparison of DNA microarray and conventional CGH analyses showed that, although 5 of 6 amplified oncogenes shown by microarray were located in chromosomal regions shown by CGH to have increased DNA copy numbers, not all genes located in such chromosomal regions were affected. One of the amplified oncogenes (SAS/CDK4) was found in a chromosomal region that was undetected by CGH. We, therefore, conclude that amplification of the oncogenes examined in this series is not directly implicated in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: c-Met is an oncogene encoding a receptor for hepatocyte growth factor and, as such, plays a key role in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We evaluated c-Met protein expression and its gene amplification in order to assess whether they were related to tumor recurrence and survival rates among patients who had undergone tumor resection.
METHODS: We used the polymer-based method to perform an immunohistochemistry analysis of c-Met expression on 59 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of surgical specimens. c-Met gene amplification was investigated with fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate relationships between c-Met expression, patient characteristics, tumor recurrence, and survival.
RESULTS: c-Met expression was associated with portal vein invasion (p = 0.006). Recurrence-free survival rates were significantly lower in patients with high levels of c-Met expression (p {\textless} 0.001). However, c-Met expression levels did not significantly affect overall survival rates (p = 0.12). Only 1 patient was found to have c-Met gene amplification; 22 patients were found to have aneuploidy of chromosome 7, on which the c-Met gene is located. Tumors with chromosome 7 polysomy tended to have higher levels of c-Met expression than those with chromosome 7 monosomy or disomy, but this difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Although c-Met expression was not significantly associated with c-Met gene amplification, it may be a useful predictive marker of recurrence in resected HCC patients.},

	abstract = {Cancer is a genetic disease with frequent somatic DNA alterations. Studying recurrent copy number aberrations (CNAs) in human cancers would enable the elucidation of disease mechanisms and the prioritization of candidate oncogenic drivers with causal roles in oncogenesis. We have comprehensively and systematically characterized CNAs and the accompanying gene expression changes in tumors and matched nontumor liver tissues from 286 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Our analysis identified 29 recurrently amplified and 22 recurrently deleted regions with a high level of copy number changes. These regions harbor established oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including CCND1 (cyclin D1), MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and CDKN2B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B), as well as many other genes not previously reported to be involved in liver carcinogenesis. Pathway analysis of cis-acting genes in the amplification and deletion peaks implicates alterations of core cancer pathways, including cell-cycle, p53 signaling, phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, Wnt signaling, and transforming growth factor beta signaling, in a large proportion of HCC patients. We further credentialed two candidate driver genes (BCL9 and MTDH) from the recurrent focal amplification peaks and showed that they play a significant role in HCC growth and survival.
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that characterizing the CNA landscape in HCC will facilitate the understanding of disease mechanisms and the identification of oncogenic drivers that may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this devastating disease.},

Expression of c-met was determined by Northern-blot hybridization of a specific probe (human met proto-oncogene) in 18 tumoral and nontumoral liver samples obtained in 18 cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma submitted to surgical treatment. Eight of the 18 hepatocellular carcinomas exhibited c-met overexpression, with an increase ranging between 2-fold and 10-fold when compared by densitometry with the surrounding liver. By contrast, in the remaining 10 cases c-met expression was almost identical to that of the surrounding nontumoral liver tissue. Overexpression of c-met was not related to either the age, sex, etiology or functional status of the underlying liver disease, or to the size of the tumor, to its differentiation degree or to the presence of pseudocapsule invasion and existence of additional neoplastic nodules. These data indicate that almost half of the human hepatocellular carcinomas exhibit c-met overexpression. Nevertheless, the biological relevance of this characteristic is not known.},

In this study, we examined c-met expression in 23 hepatocellular carcinoma cases by means of Northern-blot analysis and an immunohistochemical study. Northern-blot analysis revealed c-met mRNA expression in the tumors of 6 of 19 patients (31.6\%); in the immunohistochemical study, c-met protein was detected in 16 of 23 patients (69.6\%). With both methods, c-met was found to be overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with the surrounding normal liver. Comprehensive analysis showed that c-met protein expression was correlated with poor-to-moderate differentiation of cancer cells (p {\textless} 0.05). Tumor proliferative activity of hepatocellular carcinoma was evaluated by means of Ki-67 labeling index. All cases with increased tumor proliferative activity showed c-met protein expression, although the elevation of proliferative activity in the c-met-positive group was not statistically significant.

METHODS: Gene expressions of both c-met and hepatocyte growth factor were quantified in livers with chronic active hepatitis and in cirrhotic livers with hepatocellular carcinoma as well as in normal controls, using competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: C-met expression was significantly increased in chronic active hepatitis compared with control livers, and c-met expression in chronic active hepatitis correlated with serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Hepatocyte growth factor expression was increased in some patients with chronic active hepatitis compared with controls, and there was a significant correlation between c-met expression and hepatocyte growth factor expression. On the other hand, in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, c-met expression was increased in some cases, while that in the surrounding non-carcinomatous tissues was similar to normal controls. Hepatocyte growth factor expression was not detected in the hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and was low in the surrounding non-carcinomatous tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that hepatocyte growth factor may be involved in the regeneration of hepatocytes via paracrine mechanism in chronic active hepatitis, while in regulation of c-met expression in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues may be independent of hepatocyte growth factor stimulation.},

The c-met receptor was overexpressed in 20\%, equally expressed in 48\%, and down-regulated in 32\% of the neoplasms.

Nuclear staining of p53, indicative of a mutation(s), was observed in the great majority of the tumors (80\%), whereas no nuclear p53 was detected in peritumoral tissues. Interestingly, simultaneous down-regulation of c-met and TGF-beta-RII was observed in 23\% of the hepatocellular carcinomas, 85\% of which also showed nuclear p53 staining.

Neither HGF nor c-met expression was related to age, sex, tumor size, grading, presence of pseudocapsula, and proliferative activity of the malignant hepatocytes. A significant inverse correlation was found between c-met mRNA expression level and survival (in months) of patients (P = 0.007), as previously shown for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) mRNA (P = 0.027). In addition, c-met mRNA expression was strictly associated with u-PA mRNA level in HCC samples (P = 0.001). These data show that a loss of balance concerning HGF, c-met, and u-PA mRNA expression occurs during hepatocarcinogenesis. Particularly, up-regulation of c-met and u-PA mRNA transcription appears to be coordinately regulated, and their levels of expression are inversely correlated with survival; they must therefore play an important role in the development and progression of human HCC and may also be relevant prognostic markers.},

We wanted to identify related genes whose mRNA levels could provide markers of severity and prognosis after resection. The extent of cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation was measured with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate-biotin nick-end labeling assay, and the Ki-67 index was determined in paired tumor and cirrhotic tissue samples from patients who had undergone HCC resection after diagnosis of hepatitis C-related or alcoholism-related cirrhosis. These patients included two groups with highly versus poorly differentiated tumor cells, and the latter was split into two subgroups of those with versus without early recurrence. The mRNA levels for various apoptosis-related or proliferation-related genes and those for the growth factor/receptor systems were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in paired tumor and cirrhotic liver samples from every patient, and some of the corresponding proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry. In all instances, protein expression was highly heterogeneous within groups and similar between groups. In contrast, some differences in mRNA level between tumor and cirrhotic tissues were quite informative. Low levels of hepatocyte growth factor and transforming growth factor alpha mRNAs were found concomitantly in highly differentiated tumors, whereas overexpression of mRNAs for the cognate receptors c-met and epidermal growth factor receptor were found in poorly differentiated tumors and primarily in patients with early tumor recurrence.

	abstract = {In rat liver epithelial cells constitutively expressing transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha), c-Met is constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor. We proposed that TGFalpha and the autocrine activation of its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leads to phosphorylation and activation of c-Met. We found that there is constitutive c-Met phosphorylation in human hepatoma cell lines and the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431 which express TGFalpha, but not in normal human hepatocytes. Constitutive c-Met phosphorylation in A431, HepG2, AKN-1, and HuH6 cells was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against TGFalpha and/or EGFR. Exposure to exogenous TGFalpha or EGF increased the phosphorylation of c-Met in the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431. The increase of c-Met phosphorylation by TGFalpha in A431 cells was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against TGFalpha and/or EGFR and by the EGFR-specific inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478. These results indicate that constitutive c-Met phosphorylation, and the increase of c-Met phosphorylation by TGFalpha or EGF, in tumor cell lines is the result of the activation via EGFR. We found that c-Met in tumor cells co-immunoprecipitates with EGFR regardless of the existence of their ligands in tumor cells, but not in normal human hepatocytes. We conclude that c-Met associates with EGFR in tumor cells, and this association facilitates the phosphorylation of c-Met in the absence of hepatocyte growth factor. This cross-talk between c-Met and EGFR may have significant implications for altered growth control in tumorigenesis.},

DCP was found to bind with cell surface receptor Met causing Met autophosphorylation and also to activate STAT3 signaling pathway through Janus kinase 1. Luciferase gene reporter analysis showed that DCP induced STAT3-related transcription. Small interfering RNAs against both STAT3 and Met abrogated DCP-induced cell proliferation. DCP did not affect the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, Myc signaling pathway, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Based on these results, we believe that DCP acts as an autologous mitogen for HCC cell lines.

In this study, we constructed HepG2 cell clones expressing a high level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and examined the effect of the strong activation of ERK on the proliferation of the cell clones. EGF treatment of the cell clones induced strong activation of ERK similar to HGF treatment, but did not inhibit cell proliferation. HGF treatment of the cell clones up-regulated the expression of a Cdk inhibitor p16(INK4a), which has previously been shown to be required to inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells, but EGF treatment did not. Furthermore, EGF treatment of the cell clones did not induce the up-regulation of another Cdk inhibitor p21(CIP1), whereas HGF treatment did. Knockdown of p21 by siRNA restored the proliferation of HepG2 cells inhibited by HGF, and restored Cdk2 activity suppressed in HGF-treated HepG2 cells. These results suggest that strong activation of ERK alone is not sufficient, and some other pathway(s), which is activated through the HGF receptor but not through EGFR, is also required to induce the up-regulation of p16 and p21 expression, and also suggest that in addition to the up-regulated expression of p16, that of p21 contributes to the suppression of Cdk2 activity leading to the inhibition of proliferation of HGF-treated HepG2 cells.},

To determine the role of c-met in the malignant properties of HCC cells, we tested the effectiveness of two ablative strategies to down-modulate c-met expression in SKHep1C3, an HCC-derived cell line, i.e. stable expression of antisense RNA c-met and RNA interference. A plasmid coding a 965-nt fragment complementary to 5' portion of c-met mRNA was constructed for the antisense strategy. RNA interference methodology was applied for transient silencing, achieved by small interfering RNAs, and for stable silencing using an RNA polymerase III promoter carrying plasmid coding small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that targeted c-met. The transfected cells showed consistently lower levels of c-met mRNA and protein. The results showed that the antisense and RNAi sequences chosen to target c-met mRNA reduced c-met expression efficiently and inhibited malignant properties of SKHep1C3 cells. These data indicate that c-met is an essential factor in the processes of migration and invasion of hepatocarcinoma cells; and c-met down-regulation may be included in a therapeutic strategy for HCC in experimental animal models.},

We find that the Met mutants exhibit increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced kinase activity toward an exogenous substrate when compared with wild-type Met. Moreover, NIH 3T3 cells expressing mutant Met molecules form foci in vitro and are tumorigenic in nude mice. Enzymatic and biological differences were evident among the various mutants examined, and the somatic mutations were generally more active than those of germ-line origin. A strong correlation between the enzymatic and biological activity of the mutants was observed, indicating that tumorigenesis by Met is quantitatively related to its level of activation. These results demonstrate that the Met mutants originally identified in human papillary renal carcinoma are oncogenic and thus are likely to play a determinant role in this disease, and these results raise the possibility that activating Met mutations also may contribute to other human malignancies.},

To study the influence of these mutations on tumorigenesis in vivo, we generated mice with targeted mutations in the murine met locus. The following five mouse lines with mutant Met were created: WT, D1226N, Y1228C, M1248T, and M1248T/L1193V. We observed that mice harboring D1226N, Y1228C(,) and M1248T/L1193V mutations developed a high frequency of sarcomas and some lymphomas, whereas the M1248T mice developed carcinomas and lymphomas. Of considerable interest, we observed trisomy of chromosome 6 and duplication of the mutant met allele in a majority of the tumors, similar to what has been reported in patients with hereditary renal papillary carcinomas. These results demonstrate that activating Met mutations and met amplification play key roles in promoting tumorigenesis in vivo.

In spite of the advances of classical therapies, such as surgery, transplantation, use of radiofrequency and transarterial embolization, the prognosis of this neoplasm has not considerably improved over the past few years. The advent of targeted therapies and the approval of the systemic treatment of advanced HCC with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib have provided some hope for the future. Even if the molecular mechanisms responsible for the onset and progression of HCC are still largely unknown, new therapeutic targets have recently come to the spotlight. One of these targets is the tyrosine kinase receptor for the Hepatocyte Growth Factor, encoded by the MET gene, known to promote tumor growth and metastasis in many human organs. In this review we will summarize the contrasting results obtained in vitro (in HCC cell lines) and in animal experimental models and we will also try to analyze the reasons for the opposite findings, suggesting that the HGF/MET axis can have either a promoting or a suppressive role in the development of HCC. We will also reconsider the evidence of activation of this pathway in human HCCs and discuss the results of the clinical trials performed with MET inhibitors. The final purpose is to better clarify which can be the role of MET as a therapeutic target in HCC.},

Here we report that homozygous mutant embryos have severely impaired placentas with markedly reduced numbers of labyrinthine trophoblast cells, and die before birth. The growth of trophoblast cells was stimulated by HGF/SF in vitro, and the HGF/SF activity was released by allantois in primary culture of normal but not mutant embryos.

	abstract = {Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been reported to have both positive and negative effects on carcinogenesis. Here, we show that the loss of c-Met signaling in hepatocytes enhanced rather than suppressed the early stages of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. c-Met conditional knockout mice (c-metfl/fl, AlbCre+/-; MetLivKO) treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine developed significantly more and bigger tumors and with a shorter latency compared with control (w/w, AlbCre+/-; Cre-Ctrl) mice. Accelerated tumor development was associated with increased rate of cell proliferation and prolonged activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. MetLivKO livers treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine also displayed elevated lipid peroxidation, decreased ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, and up-regulation of superoxide dismutase 1 and heat shock protein 70, all consistent with increased oxidative stress. Likewise, gene expression profiling done at 3 and 5 months after N-nitrosodiethylamine treatment revealed up-regulation of genes associated with cell proliferation and stress responses in c-Met mutant livers. The negative effects of c-Met deficiency were reversed by chronic p.o. administration of antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. N-acetyl-L-cysteine blocked the EGFR activation and reduced the N-nitrosodiethylamine-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis to the levels of Cre-Ctrl mice. These results argue that intact HGF/c-Met signaling is essential for maintaining normal redox homeostasis in the liver and has tumor suppressor effect(s) during the early stages of N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.},

Conditional c-met knockout (KO) mice showed a higher prevalence of macroscopically visible liver tumours and of glutamine synthetase positive and glucose-6-phosphatase deficient lesions in liver.

The results reveal MET to be a crucial switch in the development of the liver; dramatize how different cellular compartments within a developmental lineage can give rise to distinctive tumor stem cells; delineate rules of tumor progression; provide evidence that the experimental tumors in mice are authentic models for human tumors; and support a role for MET in the genesis of human liver tumors.

Hepatocyte growth factor, which was injected i.v. at a dose of 200 micrograms/kg body weight one (at week 3) or two times (at weeks 3 and 4) during EHEN administration, significantly increased the development of preneoplastic glutathione S-transferase placental form-positive foci. Although the observed effects of hepatocyte growth factor were weaker than that of the two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) performed at week 3, the present results suggest that the enhancing effects of PH performed during the promotion stage may be largely mediated through induction of hepatocyte growth factor.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: It is not well clarified whether hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulates the growth of preneoplastic hepatocytes and liver carcinoma cells in vivo. The effect of HGF on in vivo DNA synthesis in these cells and also its effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of the HGF receptor protein (c-Met) in liver carcinoma were examined.
METHODS: Lesions were induced in rats using 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-Me-DAB). The rats were given intravenous recombinant human HGF or vehicle, and DNA synthesis was assessed by the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling index. Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met by HGF was analyzed by Western blot.
RESULTS: The labeling indices were significantly higher in the HGF group than in the vehicle control group in altered foci and hyperplastic nodules (preneoplastic hepatic lesions). No significant differences in the labeling indices were observed between the two groups with carcinoma. Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met in carcinoma cells was unaffected by HGF administration.
CONCLUSIONS: HGF promotes the growth of preneoplastic hepatocytes but does not affect the growth of liver carcinoma cells in 3'-Me-DAB-treated rats.},

By using a double labeling technique employing [3H]thymidine and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine to determine cell proliferation before and after HGF infusion, we determined that continuous infusion of 20 micrograms total HGF inhibited tumor cell proliferation by 50\%. The labeling in non-tumor areas showed the reverse result in that the labeling was higher in HGF-treated rats than control rats. These results indicate that HGF has different effects on growth of normal and tumorous hepatocytes in vivo. These findings may be of relevance in understanding the role of HGF in hepatocarcinogenesis and provide added modalities for controlling growth of hepatocellular carcinomas.},

We previously reported that HGF transgenic mice under the metallothionein gene promoter developed benign and malignant liver tumors spontaneously after 17 months of age. To elucidate the role of HGF in hepatocarcinogenesis, diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was administered to HGF transgenic mice. HGF overexpression accelerated DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, often accompanied by abnormal blood vessel formation. In this study, 59\% of transgenic males (versus 20\% of wild-type males) and 39\% of transgenic females (versus 2\% of wild-type females) developed either benign or malignant liver tumors by 48 weeks (P{\textless}0.005, P{\textless}0.001, respectively). Moreover, 33\% of males and 23\% of female transgenic mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while none of the wild-type mice developed HCC (P{\textless}0.001, P{\textless}0.005, respectively). Enhanced kinase activity of the HGF receptor, Met, was detected in most of these tumors. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was up-regulated in parallel with HGF transgene expression. Taken together, our results suggest that HGF promotes hepatocarcinogenesis through the autocrine activation of the HGF-Met signaling pathway in association with stimulation of angiogenesis by HGF itself and/or indirectly through VEGF.},

	abstract = {To investigate the in vivo role of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) in liver function, we generated transgenic mice using a mouse HGF/SF cDNA under the control of the mouse metallothionein gene promoter and 5'/3' flanking sequences. In adult HGF/SF transgenic mice, liver weight as a percentage of total body weight was at least twice that of wild-type mice. Comparison of transgenic and control liver morphology revealed dramatic heterogeneity in the size and appearance of hepatocytes as a distinctive feature of HGF/SF overexpression. Transgenic livers exhibited a significant increase in the number of small hepatocytes with a 2N DNA content, accounting for the observed increase in liver mass. The DNA labeling index of hepatocytes increased 11-fold at 4 weeks of age, when liver enlargement first became apparent, and was still elevated about 5-fold in adult HGF/SF transgenic mice. Moreover, hepatocytes isolated by perfusion of transgenic livers doubled every 2 days in culture, whereas little or no growth was observed with isolated control hepatocytes. The mechanistic basis of hepatocyte proliferation was elucidated as the chronic activation of the c-met proto-oncogene product. Met and substrates such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Src homology and collagen-like, pp60c-src, focal adhesion kinase p125FAK, and paxillin were associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated complexes in a hepatocyte cell line established from the transgenic liver. This proliferative stimulus triggered the formation of hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas in most transgenic mice {\textgreater} or = 1.5 years of age. Finally, the rate of transgenic mouse liver regeneration was increased 3-fold over control livers following partial hepatectomy.},

	abstract = {Attention has recently been focused on hepatocyte growth factor as a major candidate factor in liver regeneration because it is the most potent known mitogen for hepatocytes in vitro. However, hepatocyte growth factor also displays diverse activities in vitro as scatter factor, as an epithelial morphogen, as a pluripotent mitogen and as a growth inhibitor. Consequently, we developed transgenic mice that expressed hepatocyte growth factor under the control of albumin regulatory sequences to examine its in vivo role in hepatocyte growth. Hepatocytes of these mice expressed increased levels of hepatocyte growth factor as an autocrine growth factor. Hepatocyte growth factor was a potent stimulus for liver repair; the livers of hepatocyte growth factor-transgenic mice recovered completely in half the time needed for their normal siblings after partial hepatectomy. This transgenic model also enabled us to study the chronic effects of hepatocyte growth factor expression. During several months of observation, the labeling index of hepatocytes in albumin-hepatocyte growth factor mice was doubled, and liver DNA content was increased compared with that in wild-type mice. To identify intermediate signaling pathways for hepatocyte growth factor that might regulate this increased growth response, we examined transgenic mice for changes in expression of genes that are known to be regulated during liver regeneration. We found that levels of c-myc and c-jun mRNA were increased in the hepatocyte growth factor-transgenic mice. In additional experiments the increased c-myc expression was the consequence of increased transcription rates as seen in nuclear run-on and myc-CAT reporter gene experiments. We conclude that hepatocyte growth factor increases growth and repair processes when expressed for long periods in the liver and that c-myc and c-jun may be important intermediaries in the hepatocyte growth response caused by hepatocyte growth factor.},

	abstract = {Aberrant c-Met activity has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that c-Met inhibition may have therapeutic potential. However, clinical trials of nonselective kinase inhibitors with c-Met activity (tivantinib, cabozantinib, foretinib, and golvatinib) in patients with HCC have failed so far to demonstrate significant efficacy. This lack of observed efficacy is likely due to several factors, including trial design, lack of patient selection according to tumor c-Met status, and the prevalent off-target activity of these agents, which may indicate that c-Met inhibition is incomplete. In contrast, selective c-Met inhibitors (tepotinib, capmatinib) can be dosed at a level predicted to achieve complete inhibition of tumor c-Met activity. Moreover, results from early trials can be used to optimize the design of clinical trials of these agents. Preliminary results suggest that selective c-Met inhibitors have antitumor activity in HCC, with acceptable safety and tolerability in patients with Child-Pugh A liver function. Ongoing trials have been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of selective c-Met inhibition compared with standard therapy in patients with HCC that were selected based on tumor c-Met status. Thus, c-Met inhibition continues to be an active area of research in HCC, with well-designed trials in progress to investigate the benefit of selective c-Met inhibitors.

Its mortality has increased in Western populations, with a minority of patients diagnosed at early stages, when curative treatments are feasible. Only the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is available for the management of advanced cases. During the last 10 years, there has been a clear delineation of the landscape of genetic alterations in HCC, including high-level DNA amplifications in chromosome 6p21 (VEGFA) and 11q13 (FGF19/CNND1), as well as homozygous deletions in chromosome 9 (CDKN2A). The most frequent mutations affect TERT promoter (60\%), associated with an increased telomerase expression. TERT promoter can also be affected by copy number variations and hepatitis B DNA insertions, and it can be found mutated in preneoplastic lesions. TP53 and CTNNB1 are the next most prevalent mutations, affecting 25\%-30\% of HCC patients, that, in addition to low-frequency mutated genes (eg, AXIN1, ARID2, ARID1A, TSC1/TSC2, RPS6KA3, KEAP1, MLL2), help define some of the core deregulated pathways in HCC. Conceptually, some of these changes behave as prototypic oncogenic addiction loops, being ideal biomarkers for specific therapeutic approaches. Data from genomic profiling enabled a proposal of HCC in 2 major molecular clusters (proliferation and nonproliferation), with differential enrichment in prognostic signatures, pathway activation and tumor phenotype.

We have previously shown that viral integration can lead to aberrant target gene transcription. In this study, we attempted to investigate common pathways to hepatocarcinogenesis.
METHODS: By using a modified Alu-polymerase chain reaction approach, we analysed 50 HCCs along with 10 previously published cases.
RESULTS: Sixty eight cellular flanking sequences (seven repetitive or unidentified sequences, 42 cellular genes, and 19 sequences potentially coding for unknown proteins) were obtained. Fifteen cancer related genes and 25 cellular genes were identified. HBV integration recurrently targeted the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (three cases) and genes belonging to distinct pathways: calcium signalling related genes, 60s ribosomal protein encoding genes, and platelet derived growth factor and mixed lineage leukaemia encoding genes. Two tumour suppressor genes and five genes involved in the control of apoptosis were also found at the integration site. The viral insertion site was distributed over all chromosomes except 13, X, and Y.
CONCLUSIONS: In 61/68 (89.7\%) cases, HBV DNA was integrated into cellular genes potentially providing cell growth advantage. Identification of recurrent viral integration sites into genes of the same family allows recognition of common cell signalling pathways activated in hepatocarcinogenesis.},

Each integrant carried only a small fragment of the viral genome, from which the cohesive end region, the preferred site of integration, was deleted. We speculate that these deletions were made from primary integrants by recombination of regions between the viral DNA and the flanking cellular sequence.},

Preneoplastic changes in gene expression result from altered DNA methylation, the actions of hepatitis B and C viruses, and point mutations or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in selected cellular genes. Tumor progression is characterized by LOH involving tumor suppressor genes on many chromosomes and by gene amplification of selected oncogenes. The changes observed in different HCC nodules are often distinct, suggesting heterogeneity on the molecular level. These observations suggest that there are multiple, perhaps redundant negative growth regulatory pathways that protect cells against transformation. An understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC may provide new markers for tumor staging, for assessment of the relative risk of tumor formation, and open new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.},

We show here that the NS3/4A serine protease of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a virus notorious for its ability to establish persistent intrahepatic infection, causes specific proteolysis of Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF or TICAM-1), an adaptor protein linking TLR3 to kinases responsible for activating IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and NF-kappaB, transcription factors controlling a multiplicity of antiviral defenses. NS3/4A-mediated cleavage of TRIF reduces its abundance and inhibits polyI:C-activated signaling through the TLR3 pathway before its bifurcation to IRF-3 and NF-kappaB. This uniquely broad mechanism of immune evasion potentially limits expression of multiple host defense genes, thereby promoting persistent infections with this medically important virus.},

Of particular interest is the observation that a highly conserved C-terminal Class II polyproline motif within NS5A mediated association with the Src homology 3 domains of members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases and the mitogenic adaptor protein Grb2 (A. Macdonald, K. Crowder, A. Street, C. McCormick, and M. Harris, submitted for publication). In this study, we analyzed the consequences of NS5A expression on mitogenic signaling pathways within a variety of cell lines. Utilizing a transient luciferase reporter system, we observed that NS5A inhibited the activity of the mitogenic and stress-activated transcription factor activating protein-1 (AP1). This inhibition was dependent upon a Class II polyproline motif within NS5A. Using a combination of dominant active and negative mutants of components of the MAPK signaling pathways, selective inhibitors, together with immunoblotting with phospho-specific and phosphorylation-independent antibodies, we determined the signaling pathways targeted by NS5A to inhibit AP1. These studies demonstrated that in both stable NS5A-expressing cells and Huh-7-derived cells harboring subgenomic hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicons, this inhibition was mediated through the ERK signaling pathway. Importantly, a comparable inhibition of AP1 reporter activity was observed in hepatocyte-derived cell lines transduced with a baculovirus vector driving expression of full-length HCV polyprotein. In conclusion, these data strongly suggest a role for the NS5A protein in the perturbation of mitogenic signaling pathways in HCV-infected hepatocytes.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is still undefined. One possibility is the involvement of oxidative stress, which can produce genetic mutations as well as gross chromosomal alterations and contribute to cancer development. We recently showed that after a long period, the core protein of HCV induces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in transgenic mice with marked hepatic steatosis but without inflammation, indicating a direct involvement of HCV in hepatocarcinogenesis. To elucidate the biochemical events before the development of HCC, we examined several parameters of oxidative stress and redox homeostasis in a mouse model of HCV-associated HCC. For young mice ages 3-12 months, there was no significant difference in the levels of hydroperoxides of phosphatidylcholine (PCOOH) and phosphatidylethanolamine in liver tissue homogenates between transgenic and nontransgenic control mice. In contrast, the PCOOH level was increased by 180\% in old core gene transgenic mice {\textgreater} 16 months old. Concurrently, there was a significant increase in the catalase activity, and there were decreases in the levels of total and reduced glutathione in the same mice. A direct in situ determination by chemiluminescence revealed an increase in hydroperoxide products by 170\% even in young transgenic mice, suggesting that hydroperoxides were overproduced but immediately removed by an activated scavenger system in young mice. Electron microscopy revealed lipofuscin granules, secondary lysosomes carrying various cytoplasmic organelles, and disruption of the double membrane structure of mitochondria, and PCR analysis disclosed a deletion in mitochondrial DNA. Interestingly, alcohol caused a marked increase in the PCOOH level in transgenic mice, suggesting synergism between alcohol and HCV in hepatocarcinogenesis. The HCV core protein thus alters the oxidant/antioxidant state in the liver in the absence of inflammation and may thereby contribute to or facilitate, at least in part, the development of HCC in HCV infection.},

Senescence is accompanied by several changes, including an increase in inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases and telomere shortening. The mechanisms by which viral oncogenes reverse these processes are not fully understood, although a general requirement for oncoproteins such as human papillomavirus E6 and E7 has suggested that the p53 and Rb pathways are targeted. Expression of the catalytic component of telomerase, hTERT, alone significantly extends the lifespan of human fibroblasts. Here we show that telomerase activity is not sufficient for immortalization of human keratinocyte or mammary epithelial cells: we find that neither addition of hTERT nor induction of telomerase activity by E6, both of which are active in maintaining telomere length, results in immortalization. Inactivation of the Rb/p16 pathway by E7 or downregulation of p16 expression, in combination with telomerase activity, however, is able to immortalize epithelial cells efficiently. Elimination of p53 and of the DNA-damage-induced G1 checkpoint is not necessary for immortalization, neither is elimination of p19ARF.},

	abstract = {In contrast to normal differentiated cells that depend on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, cancer cells have evolved to utilize aerobic glycolysis (Warburg's effect), with benefit of providing intermediates for biomass production. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is highly expressed in normal liver tissue regulating a wide variety of biological processes including cellular metabolism, but is reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of miR-122 was shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and increase chemosensitivity, but its functions in cancer metabolism remains unknown. The present study aims to identify the miR-122 targeted genes and to investigate the associated regulatory mechanisms in HCC metabolism. We found the ectopic overexpression of miR-122 affected metabolic activities of HCC cells, evidenced by the reduced lactate production and increased oxygen consumption. Integrated gene expression analysis in a cohort of 94 HCC tissues revealed miR-122 level tightly associated with a battery of glycolytic genes, in which pyruvate kinase (PK) gene showed the strongest anti-correlation coefficient (Pearson r = -0.6938, p = {\textless}0.0001). In addition, reduced PK level was significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes of HCC patients. We found isoform M2 (PKM2) is the dominant form highly expressed in HCC and is a direct target of miR-122, as overexpression of miR-122 reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of PKM2, whereas PKM2 re-expression abrogated the miR-122-mediated glycolytic activities. The present study demonstrated the regulatory role of miR-122 on PKM2 in HCC, having an implication of therapeutic intervention targeting cancer metabolic pathways.},

	abstract = {Activated monocytes and macrophages have been postulated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Monocyte activation can be documented by measurement of neopterin, adhesion cell molecules, and certain proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We first became interested in the role of monocytes and monocyte-derived cytokines in ALD in relation to altered zinc metabolism that occurs regularly in ALD. Patients with ALD have hypozincemia, which responds poorly to oral zinc supplementation. We have shown that in ALD monocytes make a low-molecular-weight substance that, when injected into rabbits, causes prominent hypozincemia. Subsequently, multiple cytokines [especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-8] have been shown to be overproduced by monocytes in ALD. We initially showed that monocytes in ALD spontaneously produce TNF and overproduce TNF in response to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulus, and this could be attenuated by antioxidants in vitro and in vivo. Alterations in the endotoxin-binding protein LPS-binding protein, in CD14, and in the endotoxin receptor Toll-like receptor 4 all may play roles in enhanced proinflammatory cytokine signaling in ALD. Moreover, several groups have documented increased TNF receptor density in monocytes in ALD. Inadequate negative regulation of TNF occurs at multiple levels in ALD. This includes decreased monocyte production of the important antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 and blunted response to the antiinflammatory properties of adenosine. Finally, generation of reactive oxygen species (which occurs during alcohol metabolism) and products of lipid peroxidation induce production of cytokines, such as TNF and IL-8. In conclusion, there are multiple overlapping potential mechanisms for enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes in ALD. We postulate that activation of monocytes and macrophages with subsequent proinflammatory cytokine production plays an important role in certain metabolic complications of ALD and is a component of the liver injury of ALD.},

We show that both transient and stable expression of PDGF-C results in the development of liver fibrosis consisting of the deposition of collagen in a pericellular and perivenular pattern that resembles human alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Fibrosis in PDGF-C transgenic mice, as demonstrated by staining and hydroxyproline content, is preceded by activation and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells, as shown by collagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin and glial fibrillary acidic protein staining and between 8 and 12 months of age is followed by the development of liver adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. The hepatic expression of a number of known profibrotic genes, including type beta1 TGF, PDGF receptors alpha and beta, and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -2, increased by 4 weeks of age. Increased PDGF receptor alpha and beta protein levels were associated with activation of extracellular regulated kinase-1 and -2 and protein kinase B. At 9 months of age, PDGF-C transgenic mice had enlarged livers associated with increased fibrosis, steatosis, cell dysplasia, and hepatocellular carcinomas. These studies indicate that hepatic expression of PDGF-C induces a number of profibrotic pathways, suggesting that this growth factor may act as an initiator of fibrosis. Moreover, PDGF-C transgenic mice represent a unique model for the study of hepatic fibrosis progressing to tumorigenesis.},

We detected mutations in 17\% of tumours (12/72) from four countries in south Africa and the southeast coast of Asia. There was no codon 249 mutation in 95 specimens of HCC from other geographical locations including North America, Europe, Middle East, and Japan. Worldwide, the presence of the codon 249 mutation in HCCs correlated with high risk of exposure to aflatoxins and the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Further studies were completed in two groups of HBV-infected patients at different risks of exposure to aflatoxins. 53\% of patients (8/15) from Mozambique at high risk of aflatoxin exposure had a tumour with a codon 249 mutation, in contrast with 8\% of patients from Transkei (1/12) who were at low risk. HCC is an endemic disease in Mozambique and accounts for up to two thirds of all tumours in men.

	abstract = {Activation of ras proto-oncogenes occurs frequently in vivo in chemically induced rodent tumours, including rat hepatomas induced by aflatoxin B1. This study examines the in vitro activation of a human ras gene by this mycotoxin. A plasmid containing the human Ha-ras proto-oncogene, together with a neomycin resistance gene (pECneo), was incubated in vitro with a microsomal system generating aflatoxin B1 8,9-epoxide. Subsequent transfection of the plasmid into mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, followed by G418 selection and s.c. injection of surviving cells into immunodeficient mice demonstrated that the proto-oncogene had acquired transforming capacity. Although a single tumour resulted from similar treatment of incubated unconjugated plasmid, no tumours were produced by a secondary round of transfections using DNA from this tumour. Selective PCR amplification of the human Ha-ras gene in extracted tumour DNA followed by sequencing demonstrated the presence of G--{\textgreater}T transversions either at the first or middle base of codon 12 in tumours resulting from transfection with the aflatoxin-B1-modified pECneo plasmid, but this was not detected in the single tumour resulting from transfection with the unmodified plasmid. Thus, although a mutation in the Ha-ras gene has not been reported for human primary hepatomas occurring in aflatoxin-exposed populations, metabolically activated aflatoxin B1 is capable of mutating this proto-oncogene to its oncogenic form in vitro. No mutations were observed in codon 61. It appears that, in contrast to the frequently reported G--{\textgreater}T transversions in codon 249 of the p53 gene in primary hepatomas in aflatoxin-exposed humans, the failure to detect Ha-ras mutations in these tumours is not due to an inability of aflatoxin B1 to activate this proto-oncogene. The G--{\textgreater}T transversions observed in this study contrast with the most frequent aflatoxin B1 in vivo induced mutations, G--{\textgreater}A transitions in the rat Ki-ras gene.

Experimental studies in HBV-transgenic mice and woodchucks infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus were the first to show a synergistic hepatocarcinogenic effect between hepadnaviral infection and AFB1 exposure. With the availability of urinary and serum biomarkers that more accurately reflect dietary exposure to AFB1 than did the initially used food sampling and dietary questionnaires, cohort studies of patients with HCC in China and Taiwan have provided compelling evidence for a multiplicative or sub-multiplicative interaction between HBV and AFB1 in the genesis of human HCC. A number of possible mechanisms for the interaction have been suggested. Chronic HBV infection may induce the cytochrome P450s that metabolise inactive AFB1 to the mutagenic AFB1-8,9-epoxide. Hepatocyte necrosis and regeneration and the generation of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species resulting from chronic HBV infection increase the likelihood of the AFB1-induced p53 249ser and other mutations and the subsequent clonal expansion of cells containing these mutations. Nuclear excision repair, which is normally responsible for removing AFB1-DNA adducts, is inhibited by HBV x protein, favouring the persistence of existing mutations. This protein also increases the overall frequency of DNA mutations, including the p53 249ser mutation, and may contribute to uncontrolled cell cycling when p53 is non-functional.},

	abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Dysregulation of TNF-TNFR superfamily gene expression will influence many biological processes, and contributes to human diseases, including cancer. We investigated the genetic alterations of the TNF-TNFR superfamily genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several genetic alterations were detected in the 44 TNF-TNFR superfamily genes by sequencing hepatocellular carcinoma DNA samples. In particular, we found that the TNFR1 promoter -329G/T polymorphism was strongly associated with primary HCC (odds ratio [OR]=5.22, p=0.0007). We also observed frequent loss of heterozygosity at the polymorphic TNFR1 -329G/T site in the primary tumor tissues, indicating that the polymorphic TNFR1 -329G/T site is very susceptible to genetic alterations in HCC. Furthermore, in the polymorphic TNFR1 -329G/T site, the T allele resulted in the repression of TNFR1 expression. Therefore, our results suggest that TNFR1 -329G/T polymorphism may play an important role in the development of HCC.},

	abstract = {It has been well documented that the liver is an exceptional organ in which the monoallelic expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) due to genomic imprinting is relaxed during the postnatal period, resulting in biallelic expression thereafter. In the present study, changes in the status of genomic imprinting were examined in 15 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) as well as in 29 liver biopsies of chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis without clinical evidence of HCC, following screening for heterozygotes with an ApaI polymorphism in IGF2 in 34 HCCs and 80 such non-HCC cases. Extreme allelic-expression imbalance, leading to restoration of monoallelic IGF2 expression, was observed in 15 (100\%) of 15 informative HCCs for the polymorphism with this monoallelic IGF2 expression appearing to be non-random from the paternal allele. Interestingly, the same allelic-expression imbalance was also present in a significant fraction of noncancerous liver specimens of patients with underlying disease known to be associated with HCC development. In contrast, the status of genomic imprinting of H19, another gene closely mapped at 11p15 under opposite imprinting, was strictly maintained in seven (100\%) of seven cases informative for an RsaI polymorphism of H19. Together with the previous reports on altered genomic imprinting of IGF2 and H19 in embryonal lesions such as Wilms tumors as well as in lung cancers, the results suggest that perturbations of imprinting status occur as locus and tumor-type specific events in the development of human cancers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Although there are a few highly penetrant mutations that are linked directly to cancer initiation, more less-penetrant susceptibility alleles have been associated with cancer risk and progression. We used RNA sequence analysis to search for genetic variations associated with pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: We analyzed 400 paired HCC and adjacent nontumor tissues, along with clinical information, from patients who underwent surgery at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China. Total RNA was extracted from tissues and sequenced, and variations with allele imbalance were identified. Effects of variants on cell functions were investigated in HCC cell lines and tumor xenografts in mice. Variants were associated with patient outcomes.
RESULTS: We found a high proportion of allele imbalance in genes related to cellular stress. A nucleotide variation in the Oxidative Stress-Induced Growth Inhibitor 1 (OSGIN1) gene (nt 1494: G-A) resulted in an amino acid substitution (codon 438: Arg-His). The variant form of OSGIN1 was specifically retained in the tumor tissues. Functional assays showed that the common form of OSGIN1 functioned as a tumor suppressor, sensitizing HCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents by inducing apoptosis. However, the variant form of OSGIN1 was less effective. It appeared to affect the translocation of OSGIN1 from the nucleus to mitochondria, which is important for its apoptotic function. The expression pattern and localization of OSGIN1 was altered in HCC specimens, compared with adjacent liver tissue. Levels of OSGIN1 messenger RNA were reduced in 24.7\% of HCC specimens, and down-regulation was associated with shorter overall and disease-free survival times of patients. Patients with the OSGIN1 1494A variant had the shortest mean survival time (32.68 mo) among patient subgroups, and their tumor samples had the lowest apoptotic index.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified OSGIN1 as a tumor suppressor that is down-regulated or altered in human HCCs. Variants of OSGIN1 detected in HCC samples reduce apoptosis and are associated with shorter survival times of patients.},

This requires the c-Cbl tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and a juxtamembrane tyrosine residue on Met. This tyrosine provides a direct binding site for the c-Cbl TKB domain, and is absent in the rearranged oncogenic Tpr-Met variant. A Met receptor, where the juxtamembrane tyrosine is replaced by phenylalanine, is not ubiquitinated and has transforming activity in fibroblast and epithelial cells. We propose the uncoupling of c-Cbl from RTKs as a mechanism contributing to their oncogenic activation.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-13-134},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific amplification of the intended target requires that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired amplification. The process of designing specific primers typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking regions of interest are generated either manually or using software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate nucleotide sequence database using tools such as BLAST to examine the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets, such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers. The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although the BLAST program has been widely used for primer target detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as BLAST is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily return complete match information over the entire primer range.
RESULTS: We present a new software tool called Primer-BLAST to alleviate the difficulty in designing target-specific primers. This tool combines BLAST with a global alignment algorithm to ensure a full primer-target alignment and is sensitive enough to detect targets that have a significant number of mismatches to primers. Primer-BLAST allows users to design new target-specific primers in one step as well as to check the specificity of pre-existing primers. Primer-BLAST also supports placing primers based on exon/intron locations and excluding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in primers.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a robust and fully implemented general purpose primer design tool that designs target-specific PCR primers. Primer-BLAST offers flexible options to adjust the specificity threshold and other primer properties. This tool is publicly available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast.},

Here we report sequencing and deep analysis of messenger RNA and microRNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines of 462 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project--the first uniformly processed high-throughput RNA-sequencing data from multiple human populations with high-quality genome sequences. We discover extremely widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci. Altogether, this study provides a deep understanding of the cellular mechanisms of transcriptome variation and of the landscape of functional variants in the human genome.},

Imaging studies play a key role in diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, and more and more commonly, patients are being diagnosed at an asymptomatic stage. The use of triphasic computed tomography scanning and improved magnetic resonance imaging equipment and protocols has led to greater sensitivity and specificity for these techniques in diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Accurate staging of hepatocellular carcinoma is important in determining prognosis and in helping decide the best treatment for each patient. No one staging system appears optimal, but important factors to be considered are the size of the tumor, severity of underlying liver disease, and the functional status of the patient. Liver transplantation has grown in importance as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma but may be limited by availability of donor organs and long waiting times. This situation may be improved by greater use of living donor liver transplantation. Hepatic resection remains an important treatment modality for hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly in the absence of cirrhosis. Tumor ablation by alcohol injection or radiofrequency ablation is associated with favorable outcomes and may be considered a potentially curative treatment. Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma remains a key goal in improving the poor prognosis of this form of liver cancer. Identifying hepatocellular carcinoma at an early stage is often associated with having better treatment options for patients with small, asymptomatic tumors.},

We show that HBV is prone to integrate into rare fragile sites and functional genomic regions including CpG islands. We observe a distinct pattern in the preferential sites of HBV integration between tumour and non-tumour tissues. HBV insertional sites are significantly enriched in the proximity of telomeres in tumours. Recurrent HBV target genes are identified with few that overlap. The overall HBV integration frequency is much higher in tumour genomes of males than in females, with a significant enrichment of integration into chromosome 17. Furthermore, a cirrhosis-dependent HBV integration pattern is observed, affecting distinct targeted genes.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction by HBV infection has been implicated in liver carcinogenesis and disease progression with chronic inflammation via enhanced inflammation, oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage, and hepatocyte proliferation. In the natural course of HBV infection, the accumulation of naturally occurring mutations in the HBV genome can generate several mutant types of HBV-encoded proteins, including three different proteins in the S ORF (SHBs, MHBs, and LHBs) and HBcAg in the C ORF, which could contribute to enhanced ER stress in infected hepatocytes mainly via increased ER accumulation of mutant proteins. However, it seems that there may be distinct capacity and pathway in ER stress-induction and distinct resulting clinical outcomes between HBV variants. In addition, the role of HBxAg mutations in ER stress remains unknown. However, it has been reported that HBxAg itself could exert ER stress in infected cells, resulting in HCC generation in chronic HBV patients. To date, review papers regarding ER stress-mediated HBV mutation have been limited into a specific mutation type: preS2 deletion. So, in this review, we will discuss details about various mutation types in all four regions of the HBV genome (preS1, preS2, S, and C) related to ER stress and their distinct ER stress mechanisms and clinical outcomes in terms of mutation types.},

	abstract = {Allelic imbalance of the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) gene expression is often seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To investigate the role of allelic imbalance in hepatocarcinogenesis, we have studied allelic expression status of the IGF II gene in dysplastic nodules, which are precancerous lesions of HCC, as well as in HCCs of different histological grade, and the influence of the allelic imbalance on IGF II gene expression has also been examined. Allelic imbalance was observed in 3 of 7 dysplastic nodules, in 7 of 9 well-differentiated HCCs, and in 8 of 9 moderately differentiated HCCs. IGF II gene expression level, which was studied by a semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), was significantly higher (3.6-fold) in the dysplastic nodules than the control livers, but a significant increase in the IGF II gene expression was not observed in well- and moderately differentiated HCCs as compared with the control livers. These results demonstrate that the allelic imbalance of the IGF II gene expression is seen in the early stage (precancerous lesions) of hepatocarcinogenesis. Association of the allelic imbalance with an increased expression of the IGF II gene in the precancerous lesions might suggest a possible involvement of an IGF II autocrine loop in the pathogenesis of these lesions.},

We selected 160 expressed candidate genes that are involved in cancer and anticancer drug resistance for analysis of AI in a panel of cell lines that represent different types of cancers and have been well characterized for their response patterns against anticancer drugs. Of these genes, 60 contained heterozygous SNPs in their coding regions, and 41 of the genes displayed imbalanced expression of the two cSNP alleles. Genes that displayed AI were subjected to bioinformatics-assisted identification of rSNPs that alter the strength of transcription factor binding. rSNPs in 15 genes were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and in eight of these genes (APC, BCL2, CCND2, MLH1, PARP1, SLIT2, YES1, XRCC1) we identified differential protein binding from a nuclear extract between the SNP alleles. The screening process allowed us to zoom in from 160 candidate genes to eight genes that may contain functional rSNPs in their promoter regions.},

We found that large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly all known cancer genes in these tumour types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 600-5,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next stage of cancer genomics.},

	abstract = {The p53 gene contains homozygous mutations in {\textasciitilde}50–60\% of human cancers. About 90\% of these mutations encode missense mutant proteins that span {\textasciitilde}190 different codons localized in the DNA-binding domain of the gene and protein. These mutations produce a protein with a reduced capacity to bind to a specific DNA sequence that regulates the p53 transcriptional pathway. Eight of these mutations are localized in codons that account for {\textasciitilde}28\% of the total p53 mutations and these alleles appear to be selected for preferentially in human cancers of many tissue types. This article explores the question 'Why are there hotspot mutations in the p53 gene in human cancers?' Four possible reasons for this are considered; (1) the hotspot mutant alleles produce a protein that has a highly altered structure, (2) environmental mutagens produce allele-specific changes in the p53 gene, (3) these mutations arise at selected sites in the gene due to a specific DNA sequence, such as a methylated cytosine residue in a CpG dinucleotide, which has a higher mutation rate changing C to T nucleotides, (4) along with the observed change in mutant p53 proteins, which produce a loss of function (DNA binding and transcription), some mutant proteins have an allele-specific gain of function that promotes cancer. Evidence is presented that demonstrates the first three possibilities all contribute some property to this list of hotspot mutations. The fourth possibility remains to be tested.},

These efforts have uncovered an array of genes that can be positively and negatively regulated by STAT3, alone and in cooperation with other transcription factors. Through regulating gene expression, STAT3 has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in many cellular processes including oncogenesis, tumor growth and progression, and stemness. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that STAT3 may behave as a tumor suppressor by activating expression of genes known to inhibit tumorigenesis. Additional evidence suggested that STAT3 may elicit opposing effects depending on cellular context and tumor types. These mixed results signify the need for a deeper understanding of STAT3, including its upstream regulators, parallel transcription co-regulators, and downstream target genes. To help facilitate fulfilling this unmet need, this review will be primarily focused on STAT3 downstream target genes that have been validated to associate with tumorigenesis and/or malignant biology of human cancers.},

Here we have investigated the relationship between receptor signalling and traffic, and its control by specific PKC isotypes. It is shown that c-Met signalling to the ERK cascade occurs within endosomal compartments and that it is in this compartment that PKCepsilon specifically exerts its control on the pathway with the consequent accumulation of ERK in focal complexes. These events are clearly separated from the subsequent microtubule-dependent sorting of c-Met to its perinuclear destination, which is shown to be under the control of PKCalpha. Thus while it is shown that traffic to endosomes is essential for HGF/c-Met to trigger an ERK response, the subsequent traffic and signalling of c-Met controlled by these two PKC isotypes are unconnected events. The dynamic properties conferred by the PKCepsilon control are shown to be essential for a normal HGF-dependent migratory response. Thus PKCs are shown to control both receptor traffic and signal traffic to relay HGF/c-Met responses.},

	abstract = {Tissue-based diagnostics and research is incessantly evolving with the development of new molecular tools. It has long been realized that immunohistochemistry can add an important new level of information on top of morphology and that protein expression patterns in a cancer may yield crucial diagnostic and prognostic information. We have generated an immunohistochemistry-based map of protein expression profiles in normal tissues, cancer and cell lines. For each antibody, altogether 708 spots of tissues and cells are analysed and the resulting images and data are presented as freely available in the Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org). The new version 4 of the atlas, including more than 5 million images of immunohistochemically stained tissues and cells, is based on 6122 antibodies, representing 5011 human proteins encoded by approximately 25\% of the human genome. The gene-centric database includes a putative classification of proteins in various protein classes, both functional classes, such as kinases or transcription factors and project-related classes, such as candidate genes for cancer or cardiovascular diseases. For each of the internally generated antibodies, the exact antigen sequence is presented, together with a visualization of application-specific validation data, including a protein array assay, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and, in most cases, immunofluorescent-based confocal microscopy. The updated version also includes new search algorithms to allow complex queries regarding expression profiles, protein classes and chromosome location. Thus, the presented Human Protein Atlas provides a resource for pathology-based biomedical research, including protein science and biomarker discovery.},

	abstract = {Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, and there is great interest in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of individual tumors. We used systems-level approaches to analyze the genome-wide transcriptome of the protein-coding genes of 17 major cancer types with respect to clinical outcome. A general pattern emerged: Shorter patient survival was associated with up-regulation of genes involved in cell growth and with down-regulation of genes involved in cellular differentiation. Using genome-scale metabolic models, we show that cancer patients have widespread metabolic heterogeneity, highlighting the need for precise and personalized medicine for cancer treatment. All data are presented in an interactive open-access database (www.proteinatlas.org/pathology) to allow genome-wide exploration of the impact of individual proteins on clinical outcomes.},
