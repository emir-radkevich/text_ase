A common feature of cancer cell metabolism is the ability to acquire necessary nutrients from a frequently nutrient-poor environment and utilize these nutrients to both maintain viability and build new biomass. The alterations in intracellular and extracellular metabolites that can accompany cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming have profound effects on gene expression, cellular differentiation, and the tumor microenvironment. In this Perspective, we have organized known cancer-associated metabolic changes into six hallmarks: (1) deregulated uptake of glucose and amino acids, (2) use of opportunistic modes of nutrient acquisition,  (3) use of glycolysis/TCA cycle intermediates for biosynthesis and NADPH production, (4) increased demand for nitrogen, (5) alterations in metabolite-driven gene regulation, and (6) metabolic interactions with the microenvironment. While few tumors display all six hallmarks, most display several. The specific hallmarks exhibited by an individual tumor may ultimately contribute to better tumor classification and aid in directing treatment.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: MET alterations including amplifications and nucleotide variations have  been associated with resistance to therapy and aggressive clinical behavior. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The medical records of patients presenting to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Phase I Clinic with relapsed or metastatic ovarian cancers and known MET nucleotide variation or amplification status were reviewed retrospectively (n=178). Categorical and continuous clinical and molecular characteristics were compared using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, respectively. Univariate and multivariate survival were assessed  via Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis, respectively. RESULTS: MET amplification occurred in 4 (3.5\%) of 113 patients, whereas nonsynonomous nucleotide variations were present in 9 (7.4\%) of 122 patients. No patients exhibited concomitant amplification and variation. MET variations were observed only in white women with high-grade ovarian tumors, whereas amplifications were observed in both black and white women with high-grade serous ovarian primary tumors. No patients (n=4) exhibiting a MET alteration achieved an objective response when treated on a c-Met inhibitor phase I trial. In addition, ovarian cancer patients treated with a c-Met inhibitor with multikinase activity trended  towards a longer time-to-failure compared with those treated with a c-Met-specific inhibitor (median: 1.5 vs. 4.5 months, p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: MET alterations occur in a minority of patients with ovarian cancer. c-Met inhibitors with multikinase activity may exhibit less activity in ovarian cancer than c-Met  specific drugs. These findings warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {This study was focused on molecular profiling of prostate cancer (PCa) using scant amounts of both frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) PCa tissue specimens. DNA and RNA were extracted and interrogated for: (1) whole-genome gene expression profiling, (2) miRNA expression analysis, (3) SNP analysis, and (4) mutation analysis. Data was statistically analyzed and correlated with clinical and pathologic variables. Expression profiling of 47,224 genes revealed 74 genes that were significant in predicting high tumor grade in PCa (p{\textless}0.0001). These were involved in many cellular processes as analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Using novel high throughput technologies, we identified a specific oncogenomic and miRNA signatures showing loss of miR-34 expression. Interestingly, p53 was at the center hub of the signaling pathways, and the loss of miR-34a expression was consistent with the central role of p53 in PCa. Analysis of 731,442 SNP's, revealed 638 SNP's that were significant in predicting high tumor grade (p{\textless}0.0001; logistic regression analysis). We also found, for the first time, a novel hot spot mutation in MET oncogene, variant T992I, suggesting that our findings would be useful in further defining the role  of specific regulatory genes and miRNAs in the pathological evolution of PCa, and could also have potential clinical utility in improving diagnostic accuracy, refining prognostic and predictive capabilities and may serve as therapeutic targets.},

To date, these studies have revealed {\textasciitilde}140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or "drive" tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to  eight of these "driver gene" mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In developed countries, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is 5\%, and it is the second leading cause of death from cancer. The  presence of family history is a well established risk factor with 25-35\% of CRCs  attributable to inherited and/or familial factors. The highly penetrant inherited colon cancer syndromes account for approximately 5\%, leaving greater than 20\% without clear genetic definition. Familial colorectal cancer has been linked to chromosome 7q31 by multiple affected relative pair studies. The MET proto-oncogene which resides in this chromosomal region is considered a candidate for genetic susceptibility. METHODS: MET exons were amplified by PCR from germline DNA of 148 affected sibling pairs with colorectal cancer. Amplicons with altered sequence were detected with high-resolution melt-curve analysis using a LightScanner (Idaho Technologies). Samples demonstrating alternative melt curves  were sequenced. A TaqMan assay for the specific c.2975C {\textgreater}T change was used to confirm this mutation in a cohort of 299 colorectal cancer cases and to look for  allelic amplification in tumors. RESULTS: Here we report a germline non-synonymous change in the MET proto-oncogene at amino acid position T992I (also reported as MET p.T1010I) in 5.2\% of a cohort of sibling pairs affected with CRC. This genetic variant was then confirmed in a second cohort of individuals diagnosed with CRC and having a first degree relative with CRC at prevalence of 4.1\%. This mutation has been reported in cancer cells of multiple origins, including 2.5\% of colon cancers, and in {\textless}1\% in the general population. The threonine at amino acid position 992 lies in the tyrosine kinase domain of MET and a change to isoleucine at this position has been shown to promote metastatic behavior in cell-based models. The average age of CRC diagnosis in patients in this study is 63 years in mutation carriers, which is 8 years earlier than the general population average for CRC. CONCLUSIONS: Although the MET p.T992I genetic mutation is commonly found in somatic colorectal cancer tissues,  this is the first report also implicating this MET genetic mutation as a germline inherited risk factor for familial colorectal cancer. Future studies on the cancer risks associated with this mutation and the prevalence in different at-risk populations will be an important extension of this work to define the clinical significance.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include  sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this  list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

	abstract = {We have designed resequencing microarrays to test the performance of this platform when interrogating a large number of exons (164 total) from genes associated with cancer. To evaluate false positive and negative rates, dideoxy sequencing was done for 335,420 bases interrogated by the arrays. From the array  data, calls could be made for approximately 97.5\% of the bases, and false positive rates were very low with only a single mutation reported from the array  dataset for which the corresponding dideoxy trace had a clean wildtype sequence.  For the nucleotide positions where array calls were made, false negative rates were 1.41\% for heterozygous mutations. All the homozygous mutations were detected, but 8.11\% were erroneously reported as heterozygous changes from the reference sequence by the array analysis software. In addition, 20 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples were analyzed using the arrays, and both somatic and  germline mutations were found. The most interesting findings were two MET mutations that have recently been implemented in NSCLC. Large scale MALDI-TOF genotyping indicated that one of these mutations (T1010I) might represent a true  cancer-causing genotype, whereas the other (N375S) appears to be a common germline polymorphism.},

	issn = {0147-5185 0147-5185},
	abstract = {Activating mutations affecting the MET receptor tyrosine kinase are present in several types of human cancer, particularly in papillary renal cell carcinoma. Papillary thyroid carcinomas commonly express high levels of MET mRNA and protein, suggesting that increased MET signaling may be of importance in the molecular pathogenesis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate the role  of MET mutations in thyroid carcinoma, we screened MET exons 2 to 21 for mutations in sporadic papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas using denaturing high-performance chromatography. A missense MET sequence alteration T1010I, located in exon 14 encoding for the juxtamembrane domain of MET, was found in 6 (6\%) of the 104 thyroid carcinomas examined, whereas all 92 goiter samples had wild-type exon 14 (P = 0.031). Three (6\%) of the 53 papillary, 2 (10\%) of the 21 follicular, 1 (8\%) of the 13 medullary, and none of the 17 anaplastic carcinomas studied had MET(T1010I). Four of the 6 T1010I sequence alterations were present also in the germline. MET protein expression showed no apparent association with the presence of MET(T1010I), and the clinical features of the patients with cancer with MET(T1010I) were similar to those of patients whose cancer did not harbor MET(T1010I). We conclude that MET(T1010I) sequence alteration is relatively frequent in differentiated thyroid  carcinoma. The clinical and the molecular pathologic significance of this MET sequence alteration is not known.},

	volume = {63},
	issn = {0008-5472 0008-5472},
	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer, and most patients present  with cancer already spread beyond the lung. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-MET has been implicated in various solid tumors, including SCLC, and is involved in mediating tumorigenesis, cell motility, scattering, invasion and metastasis. Mutations of c-Met have been described in renal papillary carcinoma and gastrointestinal cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma. The sequence of  c-MET was examined for possible mutations in the 10 SCLC cell lines and 32 paired-SCLC/normal tissues. Novel c-MET alterations were identified among 3 of 10 separate SCLC cell lines and in 4 of 32 SCLC tumor tissue samples. These include  two different c-MET missense mutations in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain (R988C found in NCI-H69 and H249 cell lines; and T1010I in SCLC tumor sample T31). Also, there are one Sema domain missense mutation (E168D in SCLC tumor sample T5), two-base-pair insertional mutations (IVS13- (52-53)insCT in both SCLC tumor samples T26 and T27) within the pre-JM intron 13, as well as an alternative transcript involving exon 10 (H128 cell line). c-MET receptors are expressed at various levels among the 10 SCLC cell lines studied (high expression: H69, H345,  H510, and H526; medium-expression: H128 and H146; and low/no-expression: H82, H209, H249, and H446). The level of c-MET expression does not have any apparent correlation with presence or absence of mutations of c-MET in the cell lines. We  show that the two identified JM mutations (R988C and T1010I), when introduced into the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent BaF3 cell line, regulated cell proliferation resulting in a small but significant growth factor independence. When introduced into a SCLC cell line (H446, with minimal endogenous wild-type c-MET expression), the JM mutations also regulated cell morphology and adhesion,  as well as causing enhanced tumorigenicity by both increases in focus-formation and soft-agar colony-formation assays. Both of the JM mutations also increased cell motility and migration evident in wound healing assay and time-lapse video-microscopy speed analysis. The JM mutations also altered the c-MET RTK signaling, resulting in preferentially increased constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins, including the key focal adhesion protein paxillin on tyrosine residue Y31 (first CRKL-binding site), correlating with increased motility. These results suggest a novel and unique role of the JM  domain in c-MET signaling in SCLC with significant implications in cytoskeletal functions and metastatic potential. The novel JM gain-of-function somatic mutations described are the first to be reported in SCLC, and may be associated with a more aggressive phenotype. It would now be useful to study the inhibition  of c-MET as a therapeutic target against SCLC.},

	abstract = {Activating mutations in the Met receptor tyrosine kinase, both germline and somatic, have been identified in human papillary renal cancer. Here we report a novel germline missense Met mutation, P1009S, in a patient with primary gastric cancer. The dosage of the mutant Met DNA was elevated in the tumor when compared  to its matched normal DNA. Therefore, as with hereditary renal papillary cancer,  the mutant Met allele may also be selectively duplicated in the tumor. Different  from previously reported Met mutations, which occur in the tyrosine kinase domain, this missense mutation is located at the juxtamembrane domain, and is not constitutively activated. However, following treatment with HGF/SF, the P1009S mutant Met protein, expressed in NIH3T3 cells, displays increased and persistent  tyrosine phosphorylation compared to the wild-type Met. Importantly, these cells  also form colonies in soft agar, and are highly tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. A second nucleotide change in this region of Met, T1010I, was found in a breast cancer biopsy and a large cell lung cancer cell line. Although this previously reported 'polymorphism' did not stimulate NIH3T3 cell growth in soft agar, it was more active than the wild-type Met in the athymic nude mice tumorigenesis assay,  suggesting that it may have effects on tumorigenesis. Met has been shown to be highly expressed in human gastric carcinoma cell lines, and our results raise the possibility that activating missense Met mutations could contribute to tumorigenesis of gastric cancer.},

Previously, we demonstrated missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene in HPRC and a subset of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. In this study, we screened a large panel of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas and various solid tumors for mutations in the MET proto-oncogene. Summarizing these and previous results, mutations of the MET proto-oncogene were detected in 17/129 sporadic papillary renal carcinomas but not in other solid tumors. We detected five novel missense mutations; three of five mutations were located in the ATP-binding region of the  tyrosine kinase domain of MET. One novel mutation in MET, V1110I, was located at  a codon homologous to an activating mutation in the c-erbB proto-oncogene. These  mutations caused constitutive phosphorylation of MET when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Molecular modeling studies suggest that these activating mutations interfere with the intrasteric mechanism of tyrosine kinase autoinhibition and facilitate transition to the active form of the MET kinase. The low frequency of  MET mutations in noninherited papillary renal carcinomas (PRC) suggests that noninherited PRC may develop by a different mechanism than hereditary papillary renal carcinoma.},

	abstract = {Background: In developed countries, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is 5\%, and it is the second leading cause of death from cancer. The presence of family history is a well established risk factor with 25-35\% of CRCs attributable to inherited and/or familial factors. The highly penetrant inherited colon cancer syndromes account for approximately 5\%, leaving greater than 20\% without clear genetic definition. Familial colorectal cancer has been linked to chromosome 7q31 by multiple affected relative pair studies. The MET protooncogene which resides in this chromosomal region is considered a candidate for genetic susceptibility.
Methods: MET exons were amplified by PCR from germline DNA of 148 affected sibling pairs with colorectal cancer. Amplicons with altered sequence were detected with high-resolution melt-curve analysis using a LightScanner (Idaho Technologies). Samples demonstrating alternative melt curves were sequenced. A TaqMan assay for the specific c.2975C {\textgreater}T change was used to confirm this mutation in a cohort of 299 colorectal cancer cases and to look for allelic amplification in tumors.
Results: Here we report a germline non-synonymous change in the MET proto-oncogene at amino acid position T992I (also reported as MET p.T1010I) in 5.2\% of a cohort of sibling pairs affected with CRC. This genetic variant was then confirmed in a second cohort of individuals diagnosed with CRC and having a first degree relative with CRC at prevalence of 4.1\%. This mutation has been reported in cancer cells of multiple origins, including 2.5\% of colon cancers, and in {\textless}1\% in the general population. The threonine at amino acid position 992 lies in the tyrosine kinase domain of MET and a change to isoleucine at this position has been shown to promote metastatic behavior in cell-based models. The average age of CRC diagnosis in patients in this study is 63 years in mutation carriers, which is 8 years earlier than the general population average for CRC.
Conclusions: Although the MET p.T992I genetic mutation is commonly found in somatic colorectal cancer tissues, this is the first report also implicating this MET genetic mutation as a germline inherited risk factor for familial colorectal cancer. Future studies on the cancer risks associated with this mutation and the prevalence in different at-risk populations will be an important extension of this work to define the clinical significance.},

	abstract = {We have designed resequencing microarrays to test the performance of this platform when interrogating a large number of exons (164 total) from genes associated with cancer. To evaluate false positive and negative rates, dideoxy sequencing was done for 335,420 bases interrogated by the arrays. From the array data, calls could be made for w97.5\% of the bases, and false positive rates were very low with only a single mutation reported from the array dataset for which the corresponding dideoxy trace had a clean wildtype sequence. For the nucleotide positions where array calls were made, false negative rates were 1.41\% for heterozygous mutations. All the homozygous mutations were detected, but 8.11\% were erroneously reported as heterozygous changes from the reference sequence by the array analysis software. In addition, 20 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples were analyzed using the arrays, and both somatic and germline mutations were found. The most interesting ﬁndings were two MET mutations that have recently been implemented in NSCLC. Large scale MALDI-TOF genotyping indicated that one of these mutations (T1010I) might represent a true cancer-causing genotype, whereas the other (N375S) appears to be a common germline polymorphism.},

In spite of the advances of classical therapies, such as surgery, transplantation, use of radiofrequency and transarterial embolization, the prognosis of this neoplasm has not considerably improved over the past few years. The advent of targeted therapies and the approval of the systemic treatment of advanced HCC with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib have provided some hope for the future. Even if the molecular mechanisms responsible for the onset and progression of HCC are still largely unknown, new therapeutic targets have recently come to the spotlight. One of these targets is the tyrosine kinase receptor for the Hepatocyte Growth Factor, encoded by the MET gene, known to promote tumor growth and metastasis in many human organs. In this review we will summarize the contrasting results obtained in vitro (in HCC cell lines) and in animal experimental models and we will also try to analyze the reasons for the opposite ﬁndings, suggesting that the HGF/MET axis can have either a promoting or a suppressive role in the development of HCC. We will also reconsider the evidence of activation of this pathway in human HCCs and discuss the results of the clinical trials performed with MET inhibitors. The ﬁnal purpose is to better clarify which can be the role of MET as a therapeutic target in HCC.},

The versatility of MET-mediated biological responses is sustained by qualitative and quantitative signal modulation. Qualitative mechanisms include the engagement of dedicated signal transducers and the subcellular compartmentalization of MET signalling pathways, whereas quantitative regulation involves MET partnering with adaptor amplifiers or being degraded through the shedding of its extracellular domain or through intracellular ubiquitylation. Controlled activation of MET signalling can be exploited in regenerative medicine, whereas MET inhibition might slow down tumour progression.},

	abstract = {Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder where an oncogenic TP53 germline mutation is passed from parent to child. Tumor protein p53 is a key tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Paradoxically, some mutant TP53 carriers remain unaffected, while their children  develop cancer within the first few years of life. To address this paradox, response to UV stress was compared in dermal fibroblasts (dFb) from an affected LFS patient vs. their unaffected carrier parent. UV induction of CDKN1A/p21, a regulatory target of p53, in LFS patient dFb was significantly reduced compared to the unaffected parent. UV exposure also induced significantly greater p53[Ser15]-phosphorylation in LFS patient dFb, a reported property of some mutant p53 variants. Taken together, these results suggested that unaffected parental dFb may express an increased proportion of wild-type vs. mutant p53. Indeed, a significantly increased ratio of wild-type to mutant TP53 allele-specific expression in the unaffected parent dFb was confirmed by RT-PCR-RFLP and RNA-seq  analysis. Hence, allele-specific expression of wild-type TP53 may allow an unaffected parent to mount a response to genotoxic stress more characteristic of  homozygous wild-type TP53 individuals than their affected offspring, providing protection from the oncogenesis associated with LFS.},

The alterations in intracellular and extracellular metabolites that can accompany cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming have profound effects on gene expression, cellular differentiation, and the tumor microenvironment. In this Perspective, we have organized known cancer-associated metabolic changes into six hallmarks: (1) deregulated uptake of glucose and amino acids, (2) use of opportunistic modes of nutrient acquisition,  (3) use of glycolysis/TCA cycle intermediates for biosynthesis and NADPH production, (4) increased demand for nitrogen, (5) alterations in metabolite-driven gene regulation, and (6) metabolic interactions with the microenvironment. While few tumors display all six hallmarks, most display several. The specific hallmarks exhibited by an individual tumor may ultimately contribute to better tumor classification and aid in directing treatment.},

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The medical records of patients presenting to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Phase I Clinic with relapsed or metastatic ovarian cancers and known MET nucleotide variation or amplification status were reviewed retrospectively (n=178). Categorical and continuous clinical and molecular characteristics were compared using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, respectively. Univariate and multivariate survival were assessed  via Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis, respectively. RESULTS: MET amplification occurred in 4 (3.5\%) of 113 patients, whereas nonsynonomous nucleotide variations were present in 9 (7.4\%) of 122 patients. No patients exhibited concomitant amplification and variation. MET variations were observed only in white women with high-grade ovarian tumors, whereas amplifications were observed in both black and white women with high-grade serous ovarian primary tumors. No patients (n=4) exhibiting a MET alteration achieved an objective response when treated on a c-Met inhibitor phase I trial. In addition, ovarian cancer patients treated with a c-Met inhibitor with multikinase activity trended  towards a longer time-to-failure compared with those treated with a c-Met-specific inhibitor (median: 1.5 vs. 4.5 months, p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: MET alterations occur in a minority of patients with ovarian cancer. c-Met inhibitors with multikinase activity may exhibit less activity in ovarian cancer than c-Met  specific drugs.

Genetic and biochemical data have demonstrated that the growth and motility factor hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and its receptor, the tyrosine kinase MET, have a causal role in all of these processes, thus providing a strong rationale for targeting these molecules in cancer. Parallel progress in understanding the structure and function of HGF/SF,  MET and associated signalling components has led to the successful development of blocking antibodies and a large number of small-molecule MET kinase inhibitors. In this Review, we discuss these advances, as well as results from recent clinical studies that demonstrate that inhibiting MET signalling in several types of solid human tumours has major therapeutic value.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In developed countries, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is 5\%, and it is the second leading cause of death from cancer. The  presence of family history is a well established risk factor with 25-35\% of CRCs  attributable to inherited and/or familial factors. The highly penetrant inherited colon cancer syndromes account for approximately 5\%, leaving greater than 20\% without clear genetic definition. Familial colorectal cancer has been linked to chromosome 7q31 by multiple affected relative pair studies. The MET proto-oncogene which resides in this chromosomal region is considered a candidate for genetic susceptibility. METHODS: MET exons were amplified by PCR from germline DNA of 148 affected sibling pairs with colorectal cancer. Amplicons with altered sequence were detected with high-resolution melt-curve analysis using a LightScanner (Idaho Technologies). Samples demonstrating alternative melt curves  were sequenced. A TaqMan assay for the specific c.2975C {\textgreater}T change was used to confirm this mutation in a cohort of 299 colorectal cancer cases and to look for  allelic amplification in tumors. RESULTS: Here we report a germline non-synonymous change in the MET proto-oncogene at amino acid position T992I (also reported as MET p.T1010I) in 5.2\% of a cohort of sibling pairs affected with CRC. This genetic variant was then confirmed in a second cohort of individuals diagnosed with CRC and having a first degree relative with CRC at prevalence of 4.1\%. This mutation has been reported in cancer cells of multiple origins, including 2.5\% of colon cancers, and in {\textless}1\% in the general population. The threonine at amino acid position 992 lies in the tyrosine kinase domain of MET and a change to isoleucine at this position has been shown to promote metastatic behavior in cell-based models. The average age of CRC diagnosis in patients in this study is 63 years in mutation carriers, which is 8 years earlier than the general population average for CRC. CONCLUSIONS: Although the MET p.T992I genetic mutation is commonly found in somatic colorectal cancer tissues,  this is the first report also implicating this MET genetic mutation as a germline inherited risk factor for familial colorectal cancer. Future studies on the cancer risks associated with this mutation and the prevalence in different at-risk populations will be an important extension of this work to define the clinical significance.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include  sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this  list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

Clonal bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing showed different methylation levels in different somatic tissues, with the highest level recorded  in rectal mucosa and colon cancer tissue, and the lowest in blood leukocytes.

	abstract = {Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal-dominant colorectal cancer syndrome, caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, on chromosome 5q21. It is characterized by hundreds of adenomatous colorectal polyps, with an almost inevitable progression to colorectal cancer at  an average age of 35 to 40 yr. Associated features include upper gastrointestinal tract polyps, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, desmoid tumors, and other extracolonic malignancies. Gardner syndrome is more of a historical subdivision of FAP, characterized by osteomas, dental anomalies, epidermal cysts, and soft tissue tumors. Other specified variants include Turcot  syndrome (associated with central nervous system malignancies) and hereditary desmoid disease. Several genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. Attenuated FAP is a phenotypically distinct entity, presenting with fewer than 100 adenomas. Multiple colorectal adenomas can also be caused by mutations in the human MutY homologue (MYH) gene, in an autosomal recessive condition referred to  as MYH associated polyposis (MAP). Endoscopic screening of FAP probands and relatives is advocated as early as the ages of 10-12 yr, with the objective of reducing the occurrence of colorectal cancer. Colectomy remains the optimal prophylactic treatment, while the choice of procedure (subtotal vs proctocolectomy) is still controversial. Along with identifying better chemopreventive agents, optimizing screening of extracolonic cancers and applying new radiological and endoscopic technology to the diagnosis and management of extracolonic features are the major challenges for the future.},

Papillary thyroid carcinomas commonly express high levels of MET mRNA and protein, suggesting that increased MET signaling may be of importance in the molecular pathogenesis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate the role  of MET mutations in thyroid carcinoma, we screened MET exons 2 to 21 for mutations in sporadic papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas using denaturing high-performance chromatography. A missense MET sequence alteration T1010I, located in exon 14 encoding for the juxtamembrane domain of MET, was found in 6 (6\%) of the 104 thyroid carcinomas examined, whereas all 92 goiter samples had wild-type exon 14 (P = 0.031). Three (6\%) of the 53 papillary, 2 (10\%) of the 21 follicular, 1 (8\%) of the 13 medullary, and none of the 17 anaplastic carcinomas studied had MET(T1010I). Four of the 6 T1010I sequence alterations were present also in the germline. MET protein expression showed no apparent association with the presence of MET(T1010I), and the clinical features of the patients with cancer with MET(T1010I) were similar to those of patients whose cancer did not harbor MET(T1010I). We conclude that MET(T1010I) sequence alteration is relatively frequent in differentiated thyroid  carcinoma.

	issn = {0008-5472 0008-5472},
	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer, and most patients present  with cancer already spread beyond the lung. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-MET has been implicated in various solid tumors, including SCLC, and is involved in mediating tumorigenesis, cell motility, scattering, invasion and metastasis. Mutations of c-Met have been described in renal papillary carcinoma and gastrointestinal cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma. The sequence of  c-MET was examined for possible mutations in the 10 SCLC cell lines and 32 paired-SCLC/normal tissues. Novel c-MET alterations were identified among 3 of 10 separate SCLC cell lines and in 4 of 32 SCLC tumor tissue samples. These include  two different c-MET missense mutations in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain (R988C found in NCI-H69 and H249 cell lines; and T1010I in SCLC tumor sample T31). Also, there are one Sema domain missense mutation (E168D in SCLC tumor sample T5), two-base-pair insertional mutations (IVS13- (52-53)insCT in both SCLC tumor samples T26 and T27) within the pre-JM intron 13, as well as an alternative transcript involving exon 10 (H128 cell line). c-MET receptors are expressed at various levels among the 10 SCLC cell lines studied (high expression: H69, H345,  H510, and H526; medium-expression: H128 and H146; and low/no-expression: H82, H209, H249, and H446). The level of c-MET expression does not have any apparent correlation with presence or absence of mutations of c-MET in the cell lines. We  show that the two identified JM mutations (R988C and T1010I), when introduced into the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent BaF3 cell line, regulated cell proliferation resulting in a small but significant growth factor independence. When introduced into a SCLC cell line (H446, with minimal endogenous wild-type c-MET expression), the JM mutations also regulated cell morphology and adhesion,  as well as causing enhanced tumorigenicity by both increases in focus-formation and soft-agar colony-formation assays. Both of the JM mutations also increased cell motility and migration evident in wound healing assay and time-lapse video-microscopy speed analysis. The JM mutations also altered the c-MET RTK signaling, resulting in preferentially increased constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins, including the key focal adhesion protein paxillin on tyrosine residue Y31 (first CRKL-binding site), correlating with increased motility. These results suggest a novel and unique role of the JM  domain in c-MET signaling in SCLC with significant implications in cytoskeletal functions and metastatic potential. The novel JM gain-of-function somatic mutations described are the first to be reported in SCLC, and may be associated with a more aggressive phenotype. It would now be useful to study the inhibition  of c-MET as a therapeutic target against SCLC.},

Here we report a novel germline missense Met mutation, P1009S, in a patient with primary gastric cancer. The dosage of the mutant Met DNA was elevated in the tumor when compared  to its matched normal DNA. Therefore, as with hereditary renal papillary cancer,  the mutant Met allele may also be selectively duplicated in the tumor. Different  from previously reported Met mutations, which occur in the tyrosine kinase domain, this missense mutation is located at the juxtamembrane domain, and is not constitutively activated. However, following treatment with HGF/SF, the P1009S mutant Met protein, expressed in NIH3T3 cells, displays increased and persistent  tyrosine phosphorylation compared to the wild-type Met. Importantly, these cells  also form colonies in soft agar, and are highly tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. A second nucleotide change in this region of Met, T1010I, was found in a breast cancer biopsy and a large cell lung cancer cell line. Although this previously reported 'polymorphism' did not stimulate NIH3T3 cell growth in soft agar, it was more active than the wild-type Met in the athymic nude mice tumorigenesis assay,  suggesting that it may have effects on tumorigenesis. Met has been shown to be highly expressed in human gastric carcinoma cell lines, and our results raise the possibility that activating missense Met mutations could contribute to tumorigenesis of gastric cancer.},

Previously, we demonstrated missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene in HPRC and a subset of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. In this study, we screened a large panel of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas and various solid tumors for mutations in the MET proto-oncogene. Summarizing these and previous results, mutations of the MET proto-oncogene were detected in 17/129 sporadic papillary renal carcinomas but not in other solid tumors. We detected five novel missense mutations; three of five mutations were located in the ATP-binding region of the  tyrosine kinase domain of MET. One novel mutation in MET, V1110I, was located at  a codon homologous to an activating mutation in the c-erbB proto-oncogene. These  mutations caused constitutive phosphorylation of MET when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Molecular modeling studies suggest that these activating mutations interfere with the intrasteric mechanism of tyrosine kinase autoinhibition and facilitate transition to the active form of the MET kinase. The low frequency of  MET mutations in noninherited papillary renal carcinomas (PRC) suggests that noninherited PRC may develop by a different mechanism than hereditary papillary renal carcinoma.},

The cDNA nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame of 1408 amino acids with features characteristic of the tyrosine kinase family of growth factor receptors. These features include a putative 24-amino acid signal peptide and a candidate, hybrophobic, membrane-spanning segment of 23 amino acids, which defines an extracellular domain of 926 amino acids that could serve as a ligand-binding domain. A putative intracellular domain 435 amino acids long shows high homology with the SRC family of tyrosine kinases and within the kinase domain is most homologous with the human insulin receptor (44\%) and v-abl (41\%). Despite these similarities, however, we found no apparent sequence homology to other growth factor receptors in the putative ligand-binding domain. We conclude from these results that the MET protooncogene is a cell-surface receptor for an as-yet-unknown ligand.},

The effects of HGF and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are additive. The activity of HGF is not species-specific, although it does not stimulate growth in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. HGF has a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 82,000 and is a heterodimer composed of a large alpha-subunit of Mr 69,000 and a small beta-subunit of Mr 34,000. Here we report the amino-acid sequence of human HGF determined by complementary DNA cloning and the expression of biologically active human HGF from COS-1 cells transfected with cloned cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the human HGF cDNA reveals that both alpha- and beta-chains are contained in a single open reading frame coding for a pre-pro precursor protein of 728 amino acids.},

Here we present structural and functional evidence that human SF and human HGF (and also the human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen) are identical proteins encoded by a single gene, since (i) no major difference could be found by protein sequencing, by cDNA analysis, and by immunological comparison and (ii) SF in fact acts as a hepatocyte growth factor--i.e., stimulates DNA synthesis of activity--i.e., dissociates and induces invasiveness of various epithelial cells. The human SF/HGF gene was localized to chromosome bands 7q11.2-21. These results have important consequences for further studies on the involvement of SF/HGF as a modulator of cellular growth and motility in embryonal, malignant, and regenerative processes.},

Cultured human embryo fibroblasts release a protein with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of approximately 50,000 (50K) that affects epithelial cells by causing a disruption of junctions, an increase in local motility and a scattering of contiguous sheets of cells. To investigate specificity, a range of cells has been examined for the ability to produce the factor and for sensitivity to its action. Most freshly isolated normal epithelia and epithelia from cell lines of normal tissue, but not epithelia from tumour cell lines or fibroblasts, were sensitive to scatter factor. In contrast, production of the factor, as identified by activity and by chromatography, was restricted to embryonic fibroblasts and certain variants of 3T3 and BHK21 cells and their transformed derivatives. We conclude that the scatter factor is a paracrine effector of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction, which affects the intercellular connections and mobility of normal epithelial cells. The factor might be involved in epithelial migration, such as occurs in embryogenesis or wound healing.},

Mutation of the two tyrosines results in loss of biological function, as shown by abrogation of the transforming activity in the oncogenic counterpart of the receptor.

We have previously demonstrated that a single tyrosine residue in the carboxyl terminus, Tyr489, is highly phosphorylated and is essential for efficient transformation of Fr3T3 fibroblasts by Tpr-Met and for the association of Tpr-Met with the Grb2 adaptor protein and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. We show here that Tyr489 is also required for association of Tpr-Met with phospholipase Cgamma and the tyrosine phosphatase, SHPTP2/Syp. To distinguish which of these substrates are required for cell transformation by the Tpr-Met oncoprotein, we generated a novel Tpr-Met mutant that selectively fails to associate with the Grb2 adaptor protein. Utilizing this mutant, together with additional Tpr-Met mutants containing Tyr to Phe substitutions, we have demonstrated that transformation of Fr3T3 fibroblasts by the Tpr-Met oncoprotein is dependent upon pathways downstream of Shc and Grb2 and that pathways downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, phospholipase Cgamma, and SHPTP2/Syp are insufficient for transformation.},

	abstract = {Hepatocyte Growth Factor/Scatter Factor (HGF/SF) mediates a wide variety of cellular responses by acting through the Met tyrosine kinase receptor. Inappropriate expression of HGF/SF and/or Met has been found in most types of solid tumors and is often associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, constitutional and sporadic activating mutations in Met have been discovered in human papillary renal carcinomas and other cancers, while autocrine and paracrine signaling of this receptor/ligand pair has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Numerous downstream signaling molecules have been implicated in HGF/SF-Met mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis. Stat3 is a downstream signaling molecule activated by HGF/SF-Met signaling, and is reported to contribute to cell transformation induced by a diverse set of oncoproteins. Stat3 is constitutively activated in many primary tumors and tumor cell lines, suggesting that signaling by this molecule may be important for cell transformation. To address whether Stat3 is required for HGF/SF-Met mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis, we introduced a dominant-negative form of Stat3, Stat3beta into the human leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-LMS-1. We found that Stat3beta has no effect on the transformed morphology, proliferation, invasion or branching morphogenesis in vitro. By contrast, expression of Stat3beta affected HGF/SF-Met mediated anchorage-independent colony formation and prevented tumorigenic growth in athymic nu/nu mice. Thus, Met signaling through Stat3 provides an essential function for tumorigenic growth, which is manifested in vitro by loss of anchorage-independent growth.},

	abstract = {Gab1 is a substrate of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met and involved in c-Met-specific branching morphogenesis. It associates directly with c-Met via the c-Met-binding domain, which is not related to known phosphotyrosine-binding domains. In addition, Gab1 is engaged in a constitutive complex with the adaptor protein Grb2. We have now mapped the c-Met and Grb2 interaction sites using reverse yeast two-hybrid technology. The c-Met-binding site is localized to a 13-amino acid region unique to Gab1. Insertion of this site into the Gab1-related protein p97/Gab2 was sufficient to confer c-Met-binding activity. Association with Grb2 was mapped to two sites: a classical SH3-binding site (PXXP) and a novel Grb2 SH3 consensus-binding motif (PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP). To detect phosphorylation-dependent interactions of Gab1 with downstream substrates, we developed a modified yeast two-hybrid assay and identified PI(3)K, Shc, Shp2, and CRKL as interaction partners of Gab1. In a trk-met-Gab1-specific branching morphogenesis assay, association of Gab1 with Shp2, but not PI(3)K, CRKL, or Shc was essential to induce a biological response in MDCK cells. Overexpression of a Gab1 mutant deficient in Shp2 interaction could also block HGF/SF-induced activation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting that Shp2 is critical for c-Met/Gab1-specific signaling.},

	abstract = {The Gab family of docking proteins is phosphorylated in response to various growth factors and cytokines and serves to recruit multiple signaling proteins. Gab1 acts downstream from the Met-hepatocyte growth factor receptor, and Gab1 overexpression promotes Met-dependent morphogenesis of epithelial cells. Recruitment of Gab1 to Met or epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors requires a receptor-binding site for the Grb2 adapter protein and a proline-rich domain in Gab1, defined as the Met-binding domain. To determine the requirement for Grb2 in Gab1 recruitment, we have mapped two Grb2 carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain binding sites conserved in Gab1 and related protein Gab2. One corresponds to a canonical Grb2-binding motif, whereas the second, located within the Gab1 Met-binding domain, requires the proline and arginine residues of an atypical PXXXR motif. The PXXXR motif is required but not sufficient for Grb2 binding, whereas an extended motif, PX3RX2KPX7PLD, conserved in Gab proteins as well as the Grb2/Gads-docking protein, Slp-76, efficiently competes binding of Grb2 or Gads adapter proteins. The association of Gab1 with Grb2 is required for Gab1 recruitment to the EGF receptor but not the Met receptor. Hence different mechanisms of Gab1 recruitment may reflect the distinct biological functions for Gab1 downstream from the EGF and Met receptors.},
